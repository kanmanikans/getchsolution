                            </h2>
                            <p>Modern day e-commerce apps must have the following advanced and convenient features to
                                give their respective business owners an edge over their competitors and build a large
                                user base.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="1">A Swift And Simple User Registration Process
                            </h3>
                            <p>One of the main USPs of most of the mobile apps is ease of registration and use. People
                                expect almost all mobile apps to be swift and simple to use. Your e-commerce app must
                                follow suit and have a simple and straight forward registration process to bag the
                                maximum possible downloads.
                            </p>
                            <p>You must only ask essential details in your app registration process like your users’
                                name, mobile number, address, and email ids. If you ask too many irrelevant questions in
                                your app’s registration process, your potential users will get frustrated and most
                                probably will never download your e-commerce app.
                            </p>
                            <p>You can also provide your users the option to login via their social media accounts like
                                Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, LinkedIn, etcetera to further simplify and hasten your
                                e-commerce app’s registration process.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="2">Easy App Navigation
                            </h3>
                            <p>Another major USP of most of the mobile apps these days is ease of navigation and use.
                                Your users must be able to easily navigate through your e-commerce app and search for
                                their desired products with ease.
                            </p>
                            <p>This can be achieved by incorporating the ‘filter’ feature in your e-commerce app. By
                                doing so, your users will be able to filter products listed on your e-commerce app via
                                categories, brand names, and other specifications.
                            </p>
                            <p>This feature will enable your app users to easily find what they’re looking for. You can
                                also incorporate a search bar in your e-commerce app to further simplify and hasten the
                                searching and buying process. Your app users can simply type the name of the product
                                they’re looking for and have it listed on your e-commerce app.
                            </p>
                            <p>The more simple and swift your e-commerce app is, the more downloads it’ll bag and the
                                larger your user base and customer retention will be.
                            </p>

                            <p>Gone are the days when people had to pay via cash for everything and had to have the
                                exact change with them. In India especially, after the demonetization move took place in
                                November 2016, people began to discover the accuracy, swiftness, and security of online
                                payment methods like net banking, UPIs, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>Since then, online payment methods gained immense popularity and usage in India. Online
                                payment methods have now become so popular in India that people expect them to be
                                incorporated in apps wherever applicable.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hence, your e-commerce app must have a plethora of swift and secure online payment
                                options like net banking, UPIs, digital wallets, etcetera built into it to make a big
                                appeal on your target audience and to bag the maximum possible downloads. After all,
                                money is precious to everyone and must be transacted safely.

                            <p>If your e-commerce app is built partly using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, it can
                                give buying suggestions to your app users based on their previous purchases (the app
                                will get an idea of your users’ tastes and suggest products to them). According to a
                                recent research conducted in the US, smart product recommendations have been proven to

                            <p>Your e-commerce app can have AR based features that enable it to access your users’
                                smartphones’ cameras to analyze any product image in front of it and tell your users if
                                the product is a right fit for them or not.

                            </p>

                                This is quite an advanced and futuristic feature that even popular e-commerce apps like
                                Amazon don’t have.

                            </h2>
                            <p>Unfortunately or fortunately, there is no fixed cost to developing an e-commerce app. The
                                cost to develop ecommerce app depends on a multitude of factors that are listed below.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="9">The Number And Complexity Of App Features You Want</h3>
                            <p>If you only want a basic e-commerce app with rudimentary features, it can be developed
                                with a relatively small budget and app development team. On the contrary, if you want to
                                develop a state-of-the-art e-commerce app with all the advanced and convenient features
                                as stated in the previous sections, you’ll have to be prepared to spend a small fortune.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is because developing an advanced e-commerce app with elaborate and complex features
                                takes a lot of app development time, a large app development team, and a great deal of
                                technical expertise. So, you must develop a e-commerce app that best suits your budget
                                and business requirements.
                            </p>

                            <p>Apps for the Android and iOS mobile OS paltforms are coded in different programming
                                languages namely Kotlin and Swift respectively. Both these programming languages have
                                different levels of capabilities and ease of learning and implementation. Hence,
                                naturally, you’ll be charged variedly depending on whether you’re developing an
                                on-demand e-commerce app for Android, iOS, or both the platforms (hybrid apps).

                                subscribe for it then obviously you’ll be charged for it depending on the agency’s
                                monthly rate and how many months of app maintenance you have subscribed for.
                            </p>
                            <p>Subscribing for six months to one year of app maintenance service is an ideal choice.
                                Generally speaking, cost of ecommerce app development ranges between USD 20,000 to USD
