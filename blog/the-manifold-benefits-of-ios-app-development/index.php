                                supported by Google and the other one is
                                iOS apps supported by Apple. Android apps have about 72% of the app market share and iOS
                                apps have about 27% of the app market share. When considering the benefits of iOS app

                                market. Despite having a smaller market share than Android apps, <a

                            <h2>The Prime Benefits Of Ios App Development</h2>
                            <p> <a href="">Developing an official iOS app</a> will give your business many benefits in
                                all aspects, especially in terms of the benefits of iOS app development. Some of the
                                important ones are discussed below.</p>

                            <h3 id="1">Great UI/UX</h3>
                            <p>It’s easier to design a user interface for an iOS app than an Android app since there is
                                not much size variation between iphones unlike Android smartphones.
                                Also, iOS apps have a far greater native hardware compatibility than Android apps.
                                Hence, they are able to give their users a far better experience than Android apps. iOS
                                apps are faster and work more seamlessly than Android apps.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Greater Securityr</h3>
                            <p>iOS apps have a higher data security level than Android apps. They are better protected
                                against malware, hacking, data phishing and computer virus attacks. All the monetary
                                transactions carried out for in-app purchases and other purposes
                                are end to end encrypted via a very secure encryption algorithm. The occurrence of data
                                theft and manipulation, and duplication from iOS apps is almost non-existant.</p>

                            <h3 id="3">Loyal User Base</h3>
                            <p>Iphone and iOS app users are mostly highly educated and well-settled people living in
                                developed countries like the US, UK, Australia, Europe, Singapore, and Canada. These
                                users will not hesitate to spend more money to buy a good iOS app and for in-app
                                purchases.
                                They will be prepared to spend a significant sum on any iOS app if they get a smooth
                                experience from it. </p>
                            <p>So, as a general rule, iOS app developers get a much higher ROI than Android app
                                developers and need not take as much effort to maintain their userbase as Android app
                                developers as iphone and iOS app users are more loyal to Apple and trust its products.
                            </p>


                            <h3>The Elaborate Yet Effective IOS App Development Process</h3>
                            <p>The process to develop an iOS app is elaborate yet effective and fail-proof. The App
                                Store has a very high standard and
                                criteria for accepting and listing iOS apps. Hence, iOS apps have to be designed
                                carefully and with perfection. The process of developing an iOS app is described in
                                detail below.</p>

                            <h3 id="4">Requirement Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Only apps that are in demand get lots of downloads and positive user reviews. Therefore,
                                iOS app designers have to study their target audience’s requirements
                                first and design their iOS apps to satisfy those requirements to get the maximum
                                possible app downloads and positive user reviews.</p>
                            <p>iOS app designers can also study the features of their competitors’ apps and look to
                                incorporate any innovate and useful features into their apps. They must also look to
                                incorporate their own unique and useful features into their iOS apps to make their apps
                                stand out among the competition and to gain an edge over their competitors.</p>

                            <h3 id="5">Read And Understand The App Store’s Guidelines</h3>
                            <p>The App Store has very strict rules and guidelines to accept and list iOS apps.
                                Therefore, iOS app designers have to be updated with the latest app design guidelines
                                and criteria laid out by The App Store and implement them while designing their iOS apps
                                so that their iOS apps can be listed on The App Store.
                                Even the modifications and upgrades that they make to their iOS apps have to be
                                compliant with The App Store’s rules and criteria. </p>
                            <p>After all, there is no point in spending a lot of time, money, and effort designing iOS
                                apps and upgrading them if they are not compliant with The App Store’s rules and
                                criteria and will get rejected as a consequence.</p>

                            <h3 id="6">Designing A Wireframe For The App</h3>
                            <p>After having understood their target audience’s requirements and The App Store’s
                                guidelines, iOS app designers design a wireframe for their iOS apps. </p>
                            <p>The wireframe will give the app designer and other team members a fair idea of what the
                                iOS app is going to look like and what features it will have. A wireframe of an app is
                                usually revised many times before the final design can be arrived at. </p>
                            <p>iOS app designers have to ensure that their iOS app is fully featured, is innovatively
                                designed, is easy to navigate, and is engaging for their users so that their iOS apps
                                get the maximum possible downloads, positive user reviews, and give their respective
                                business owners, an edge over their competitors.</p>


                            <h3 id="7">Coding The App</h3>
                            <p>The front end and back end coding for the iOS app has to be done according to
                                internationally recognized app design practices and keeping in mind your target
                                audience’s requirements and The App Store’s latest guidelines.The source code of your
                                iOS app has to be concise and efficient and occupy as little phone memory space as
                                possible. It must enable all the features necessary for the app. </p>
                            <p>The “Swift” coding technology was invented by Apple in 2014 and has replaced Objective C
                                as the coding language of choice for designing native iOS apps. The Swift coding
                                technology is very robust and is easy to learn. That’s why app designers prefer to
                                design native iOS apps these days.</p>

                            <h3 id="8">Testing The App</h3>
                            <p>If you want your iOS app to give its users a great experience, you must test it
                                thoroughly under all use case scenarios. Your iOS app must perform swiftly and smoothly
                                under all use case scenarios to give its users a great experience and thereby heighten
                                your user engagement and retention.</p>

                            <h3 id="9">App Maintenance And Upgrade</h3>
                            <p>You must maintain your iOS app periodically and update it if necessary to enable it to
                                consistently give its users a great experience and satisfy their changing requirements.
                            </p>
