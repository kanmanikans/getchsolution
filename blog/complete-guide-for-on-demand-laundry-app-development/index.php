                            <h2 id="2">How Does Online Laundry Work?</h2>
                            <p>You can create a laundry app for Android as well as iOS mobile devices. The app operates
                                in the following way:</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">

                                <li>Users register themselves on the app and login into their respective accounts.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Users are able to schedule their laundry services on the app depending on the
                                    available time slots. The time slots that are not available are grayed out on the
                                    app.</li>
