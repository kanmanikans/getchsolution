                            <h3 id="1">Heightened Brand Awareness</h3>
                            <p>Popular social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Quora,
                                TikTok, etcetera have billions of people and thousands of brands registered on them.
                            </p>
                            <p>Therefore social media platforms are a great forum for brands to advertise themselves and
                                interact with their target audience. This will enhance brand awareness multifold.
                                ‘Groups’ on social media platforms help brands to precisely identify and reach out to
                                their target audience.</p>
                            <p>Via social media platforms, brands can get to know what their competitors are upto, which
                                will help them to devise better business strategies to improve their business in all
                                aspects. </p>
                            <p>By “listening” to (analyzing) people’s demands and trends and by actively advertising
                                their products or services, brands can provide what their target audiences want and
                                thereby heighten their business volume and profits.</p>
                            <h3 id="2">Augmented Website Traffic</h3>
                            <p>Since just a few social media platforms cover billions of people and a wide array of
                                target audiences, brands can utilize this fact and market themselves on suitable social
                                media platforms to reach and influence the maximum number of potential customers.</p>
                            <p>Every social media platform has its advantages and disadvantages and is better suited for
                                businesses from different industries. So, you must analyze which social media platforms
                                are apt to market your business and focus your marketing campaigns on those social media
                                platforms to derive the best results. </p>
                            <h3 id="3">Improves Your Search Engine Rankings</h3>
                            <p>Not many people are aware of this but Google attaches different levels of importance to
                                online traffic from different social media platforms. </p>
                            <p>Online traffic from LinkedIn ups a website’s DA (Domain Authority) and PA (Page
                                Authority) by significant amounts. Internet traffic from Twitter marginally improves a
                                website’s DA and PA and online traffic from Facebook does not have a noteworthy impact
                                on a website’s DA and PA. </p>
                            <p>Even if your website’s authority does not increase shortly due to visitors from various
                                social media platforms, that online traffic will surely become a ranking factor for your
                                website in the long run. Google ranks websites with a lot of online traffic higher on
                                its SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages).</p>
                            <h3 id="4">Higher Lead Conversion Rate</h3>
                            <p>Social media platforms give you an opportunity to interact publicly and personally with
                                your target audience. Hence, you can enhance brand awareness, customer engagement, lead
                                conversion rate, sales, and profits all at once via social media platforms. This is not
                                possible via traditional means of advertising. </p>
                            <p>Social media platforms are vibrant and happening forums where you can interact with your
                                target audience and improve your business in all aspects. You can listen to the demands
                                and grievances of your target audience and address those demands and shortcomings so
                                that the quality of your products and/or services can be improved. </p>

                                plans for your business and thereby “build a personality” for it which will enhance your

                            <h3 id="5">You Can Convert Your Existing Customers Into Brand Evangelists</h3>
                            <p>As mentioned before, social media platforms enable you to interact with your customers
                                and target audience on your business page, related groups, and via personal chats and
                                emails. </p>
                            <p>This provides a great opportunity for you to build a better rapport with your customers
                                and target audience and augment the popularity and reputation of your brand. </p>
                            <p>Your interaction with your customers and target audience must be effective and have a
                                human touch to it. Your customers must not feel like they’re chatting with a chatbot.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you resolve your customers’ queries and complaints in an effective and friendly
                                manner, you can eventually convert them into your brand’s evangelists who will give your
                                brand manifold benefits in the long run.</p>
