                            <p>The corporate environment is highly dynamic owing to ever-changing business/project
                                needs. This fact is especially true for firms in the IT industry, with each software
                                project requiring unique coding skill sets.</p>
                            <p>Now, if an IT company were to hire new full-time programmers, skilled in various coding
                                technologies, every time a project with unique technical requirements arises, it would
                                cost the company a lot of money in many ways like:</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <p>Paying monthly salaries, allowances, and incentives to full-time programmers would
                                    definitely cost an IT company a lot more money than contracting skilled resources
                                    who don’t need to be paid allowances or incentives. Just the contract quote or the
                                    hourly rates in the case of freelance developers need to be borne by the IT company,
                                    which will certainly be less than full-time programmers’ salaries, allowances, and
                                    incentives.</p>
                                <p>If a new project does not need a full-time programmer’s coding skill sets, that
                                    programmer will still have to be paid monthly salaries and allowances even though he
                                    is not being utilized by the IT company. This is definitely a wasteful expenditure
                                    for the IT company. Even if there are a few under-utilized or unutilized resources,
                                    it will drain a significant amount of the IT company’s money.</p>
                                <p>In Resource Augmentation, the contracted skilled resources can be expanded or cut
                                    down in accordance with the dynamic project requirements. If an IT company (or any
                                    other organization for that matter) were to do this with its permanent employees, it
                                    would lead to massive strikes, defamation, and lawsuits filed by the employees. The
                                    entire reputation and operationality of the IT firm would be in jeopardy.</p>
                                <p>IT staff augmentation is a service that provides businesses with additional IT
                                    resources on a temporary or contract basis. This can be helpful for businesses that
                                    need to scale up their IT team quickly or need access to specialized skills that
                                    they do not have in-house.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Hence, IT companies and many other companies prefer to avail staff augmentation services
                                from reputed service providers instead of hiring full-time coders for their interim
                                project needs these days. This practice enhances the operational efficiency and the
                                profit margins of IT firms while cutting down on their unnecessary expenditures.</p>
                            <h2 id="1">Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation Services</h2>
                            <p>IT augmentation services have proven to be beneficial to IT firms as well as programmers
                                thus creating a win-win situation for both parties.</p>
                            <h3>What’s In It For IT Firms?</h3>
                            <p>IT firms need not pay dedicated salaries, allowances, and incentives to the contracted
                                resources. Just the contract cost/quote or hourly charges in the case of freelance
                                programmers need to be borne by them, which will be a lot less than paying full-time
                                developers their salaries, allowances, and incentives.</p>
                            <p>The question of under-utilization or wastage of skilled resources does not arise as the
                                developers are contracted as per the temporary project requirements. Upon successful
                                completion of the project, the expenditure for the IT company ends. It need not continue
                                paying salaries and allowances until the next project arrives as it is in the case of
                                hiring full-time developers.</p>
                            <p>Even the leased developer team can be expanded on curtailed according to the changing
                                project requirements. There is no commitment to continue employing or paying any
                                developer. That’s a big relief for IT firms, which can now concentrate on correctly
                                executing their ephemeral projects.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the contracted resources can work and coordinate from any
                                geographical location. They need not come to the company’s location/office as they are
                                not employees of the company. So, the IT companies can look for skilled resources from
                                any corner of the globe.</p>
                            <p>Here are some additional benefits of using IT staff augmentation services:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Cost savings:</b>IT staff augmentation can help you save money on hiring and

                                    up or down as needed.</li>
                                <li><b>Access to specialized skills:</b> IT staff augmentation gives you access to a
                                    wider pool of talent, including experienced professionals who may not be available
                                    for full-time employment. This can help you fill skill gaps and complete projects
                                    more quickly.</li>
                                <li><b>Flexibility: </b>IT staff augmentation service gives you the flexibility to scale
                                    your IT team up or down as needed. This can be helpful for businesses that
                                    experience seasonal fluctuations in demand or that are launching new projects.</li>
                                <li><b>Peace of mind: </b>When you use IT staff augmentation services, you can be
                                    confident that you are working with experienced professionals who are committed to
                                    your success.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>What’s In It For The Contracted Resources?</h3>
                            <p>Any developer (freelance or contracted) can look to hone his skill sets in one or a few
                                coding technologies and work on temporary projects for various organizations.</p>
                            <p>Full-time developers working for various IT firms are often required to painstakingly
                                learn a wide array of new coding technologies to make them usable in new projects.</p>
                            <p>Not many people can perfect themselves in many coding technologies. Sometimes, the
                                programmers who have just learnt new coding technologies make big mistakes in the
                                outsourced projects, which will lead to loss of time, money, and reputation for the IT
                                companies.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the employees of the IT staff augmentation service provider firm can
                                also grow in the company, depending on the number of projects they have completed
                                successfully. The contracted resources (usually freshers in the industry) can add
                                weightage in their resume this way and look to jump to reputed IT organizations and earn
                                more or become entrepreneurs themselves in the near future.</p>
                            <h2 id="2">The Elaborate Yet Effective IT Staff Augmentation Process</h2>
                            <p>If an IT firm has to contract skilled resources for its evanescent project needs from a
                                staff augmentation service provider, there are quite a lot of procedures and formalities
                                to be followed, which are stated below.</p>
                            <h3>Discussing The Project Requirements</h3>
                            <p>The IT company and the Resource Augmentation (RA) service provider get to know about each
                                other and interact with each other via an official website forum. The two companies fix
                                an official date and time for project requirement discussions.</p>
                            <p>The IT firm states its project requirements to the RA service provider. The RA service
                                provider firm will check if it has the required skilled resources to meet the project
                                requirements of the IT firm. If it has the required skilled resources, then a business
                                contract is signed between the two parties.</p>
                            <p>The next step in the IT staff augmentation process is for the RA service provider to
                                onboard the new team members. This includes providing them with training on the IT
                                firm's systems and processes. The RA service provider will also work with the IT firm to
                                ensure that the new team members are integrated into the team and are able to contribute
                                effectively.</p>
                            <p>Various project parameters like the client’s (IT company) functional requirements, the
                                project’s deadline, the project’s quote, and miscellaneous requirements will be
                                mentioned in the contract. It is the duty of the RA service provider organization to
                                meet or exceed all of the parameters mentioned in the contract.</p>
                            <p>The client company also reserves the right to expand or shrink its contracted (augmented)
                                workforce and also to cancel the project midway in case it is not satisfied or there is
                                a change of plans or business requirements. The RA service provider firm has to read and
                                thoroughly understand the T&Cs of the contract before signing it.</p>
                            <h3>Perfectly Executing The Project</h3>
                            <p>The employees of the RA service provider firm have to ensure that they understand all of
                                their client’s project requirements thoroughly and execute the project to the t. They
                                should hold regular meetings with their client and discuss the progress of the project
                                to avoid ambiguity for their client and to eradicate the chances of failure of the
                                project.</p>
                            <p>The client may also come up with additional project requirements or modify their stated
                                requirements during the course of the execution of the project. All of those changes
                                must be incorporated into the project by the staff augmentation services company.</p>
                            <p>The confidentiality of the client’s project details must be maintained by the staff
                                augmentation services company throughout the project and even after the successful
                                completion of the project lest the client’s business will be affected and the client
                                could file a lawsuit against the RA firm.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the project must be completed to the client’s satisfaction on or
                                before the given deadline to preserve the integrity and the reputation of the RA service
                                provider company.</p>
                            <p>Successfully completed projects are like medals or certificates for the RA service
                                provider organization. They can portray their clients’ positive reviews on their
                                official website to enhance their popularity and reputation and also to gain more
                                clients in the future.</p>
                            <h3>Receiving Payments</h3>
                            <p>Upon successful completion of the project, the IT company will pay the RA service
                                provider company the quoted amount in the contract.</p>
                            <p>This payment may even be done in full before the commencement of the project, after
                                signing the contract or the IT company may pay some advance amount before the
                                commencement of the project and settle the due amount after the successful completion of
                                the project. It is entirely up to the negotiating firms how they wish to make and
                                receive payments for the project.</p>
                            <h2 id="3">Pros and Cons of Staff Augmentation?</h2>
                            <p>IT staff augmentation services have the following noteworthy benefits</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <p>Companies can fulfill their interim project requirements without hiring new full-time
                                    developers who need to be paid salaries, incentives, and allowances, which is much
                                    costlier than contracting skilled developers.</p>
                                <p>The size of the contracted team can be expanded or reduced dynamically, depending on
                                    the project requirements. There is no commitment on behalf of the client company to
                                    hire or pay the contracted resources permanently. This convenience will enable the
                                    efficient and cost-effective execution of the project by the IT firm.</p>
                                <p>The contracted skilled resources can even work and coordinate with the client’s team
                                    remotely. They need not come to the client’s office location as they are not
                                    employees of the client company. This way, IT companies can search for skilled
                                    resources to satisfy their project requirements even globally. They will not be
                                    restricted to searching for skilled resources in any geographical region.</p>
                                <p>Since the skilled human resources are contracted only based on the project’s needs,
                                    there is no under utilization or wastage of developers unlike in the case of hiring
                                    full-time developers.</p>
                                <p>The chances of programmers making big mistakes in the client’s project are wafer-thin
                                    as the RA service provider firm first checks if it can meet its client’s project
                                    requirements with its skilled programmers before signing the contract with the IT
                                    firm.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The RA firm’s employees are not forced to learn new coding technologies just to satisfy
                                some temporary project requirements. RA firms often have a standard set of coding
                                technologies, they offer assistance in.</p>
                            <p>If new coding skills are required for the project, then at best the RA firm may hire new
                                developers with the required skill sets.</p>
                            <p>The only possible con of team augmentation services is that the IT company’s staff may
                                take some more time to gel (efficient coordination) with the contracted team in
                                comparison to mingling with and coordinating with their own new employees hired for the
                                project.</p>
                            <p>Clearly the merits or RA service far outnumber the demerits of RA services. Hence,
                                availing staff augmentation to managed services from reputed service providers is always
                                desirable for IT firms as well as organizations in other sectors.</p>
