                            <h2>What Is App Store Optimization (ASO)</h2>


                            <p>App Marketing, also known as App Store Optimization (ASO) is the process of
                                applying appropriate optimization techniques to one’s app to make it appear on
                                app store searches namely Play Store for Android apps and The App Store for iOS
                                apps. </p>
                            <p>Only if an app is visible on app stores will users get to know about it, check
                                out its screenshots and description, and ultimately consider downloading the
                                app. The process of ensuring that users download the app once they visit the
                                app’s page on app stores is called Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). </p>
                            <p> ASO is quite similar to the <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/digital-marketing/seo-company/">SEO
                                    process applied for websites</a>. Keywords optimization, getting valuable
                                backlinks, and maximizing the lead conversion rate are common to both the
                                processes.</p>
                            <p>
                            <p>However, there also exist a few differences between the processes. Prominent
                                among them are two facts. One is that ASO techniques are applied to mobile apps
                                whereas SEO techniques are applied to websites. The other one is that a few
                                ranking criteria and parameters vary between the two processes.</p>
                            </p>

                            <h2 id="1">2. The Importance Of App Marketing</h2>
                            <p>As mentioned at the beginning of this article, merely <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/effective-mobile-app-development-process-to-be-adopted-in-2022/">developing
                                    an official app for your business</a> is not enough. You need to apply
                                appropriate ASO techniques to make your app rank on app stores and appear in app
                                store searches. However, the benefits of ASO techniques don’t stop there. There
                                are quite a few other significant benefits to ASO which we’ll have a look at in
                                detail in this section</p>

                            <h3 id="2">How do I get organic traffic to my apps</h3>

                            <p>If you have applied the appropriate ASO techniques to your official app, it will
                                rank organically in the app store it was designed for or both the app stores in
                                case of hybrid apps. You don’t have to pay Google’s Play Store or Apple’s The
                                App Store any amount to list your app on them. You will get free global or
                                regional visibility and a high amount of app downloads if you organically rank
                                your app on app stores. Isn’t that convenient?</p>

                            <h3 id="3">Your App Will Be Seen By Your Target Audience</h3>

                            <p>Applying appropriate ASO techniques to your official app will make it visible
                                among your target audience on the target app store or app stores in the case of
                                cross-platform apps. </p>
                            <p>By incorporating the target keywords that your target users are searching with
                                and by applying the appropriate category filters to your app, your app will only
                                be visible among your target audience who are searching for the services that
                                you provide. This will maximize the chances of your app getting downloaded by
                                your target audience.</p>
                            <p>Your app will not be displayed to people who are not seeking your services and
                                thereby rendering your app development effort useless.</p>

                            <h3 id="4">A Lot Of Earning Potential</h3>

                            <p>Once you organically rank your app on app stores and once your app gets a lot of
                                downloads, you can earn a lot of money from your app if you have monetized it in
                                one or multiple ways. </p>
                            <p>You can earn money via in-app ads, in-app purchases, and a subscription model.
                                Since there are a lot of millennials and netizens in the world who extensively
                                use mobile apps on a daily basis, the earning potential of mobile apps is truly
                                enormous. </p>

                            <h3 id="5">Stability In App Downloads And Digital Income</h3>

                            <p>Once your app ranks on the target app store/s, you must not sit back and relax.
                                You must frequently listen to the reviews of your users and implement any
                                meaningful suggestions given by them. You can also address their pain points
                                stated in their complaints. </p>
                            <p>This is the best way to keep your app up to date and your users satisfied. If
                                your users are satisfied from time to time, app downloads and online income via
                                your official app will keep flowing.</p>

                            <h2>What Are The Best App Marketing Strategies?</h2>
                            <p> Now that you have understood the importance of app marketingfor your official
                                app, you also need to know about the most effective and practices so that you
                                can apply them to your official app and reap the manifold benefits of those
                                practices including app store visibility and numerous app downloads. The most <a

                                    app</a> mobile app marketing Strategies are as given below</p>

                            <h3 id="6">Understand The Demands Of Your Target Audience</h3>

                            <p>Before even beginning to code your app, you must thoroughly analyze and
                                understand the requirements and expectations of your target audience and design
                                your app accordingly. </p>
                            <p>An app that does not address the target audience’s requirements is just a
                                complete waste of time, money, and effort. It will not be in demand on app
                                stores and will hardly get any downloads leave alone being able to generate
                                online income. </p>
                            <p>On the contrary, an app that is well-designed and addresses users’ needs and
                                meets their expectations will be in high demand on app stores and thereby
                                receive a lot of downloads and it can even generate online income for its
                                business owner. </p>

                            <h3 id="7">Incorporate Suitable Keywords</h3>

                            <p>You must ensure that your app is optimized for those keywords that your target
                                audience uses to search for apps on app stores so that your app can be
                                discovered on relevant app store searches. </p>
                            <p>The keywords that you choose must be relevant to your app and niche. They must
                                also have high search volumes but low competition. Only then will you get the
                                best search results for your app. </p>
                            <p>Research has found that 63% of people discover and download apps by searching on
                                app stores. This fact just underlines the importance of the application of
                                appropriate App Store Optimization (ASO) practices.</p>

                            <h3 id="8">Select A Catchy Name For Your App</h3>

                            <p>The name of the app is the first thing that people see on app stores. Only if the
                                name of an app is catchy will people even bother to read its description,
                                ratings, and reviews. Research has shown that catchy app names augment app
                                downloads by 10%. </p>
                            <p>If you’re developing hybrid apps, you need to be mindful of the character limits
                                set by Play Store and The App Store. The character limit of Play Store is 50
                                characters and the character limit of The App Store is 30 characters. Therefore,
                                the names of hybrid apps should be less than or equal to 30 characters to be
                                eligible to be listed on The App Store as well.</p>

                            <h3 id="9">Write A Compelling App Description</h3>
                            <p>On both Play Store and The App Store, the character limit for app descriptions is
                                4,000 characters. You can make good use of this wide character limit to write a
                                compelling app description that will heighten your app downloads. </p>
                            <p>Your app description has to be as appealing and informative as possible. It has
                                to clearly state what pain points the app addresses, what are the app’s unique
                                features (if any), what are the minimum configuration requirements of the app,
                                how good will be the performance of the app, and how your app is extraordinary
                                and not a “run of the mill” app. </p>

                            <h3 id="10">Have Informative And Appealing Screenshots</h3>
                            <p>People, who don’t have the time to go through your app description will have a
                                look at the in-app screenshots that you have uploaded. The quality of those
                                screenshots will determine if users download your app or not. </p>
                            <p>The screenshots taken from important use cases of your app, should convince
                                potential users of your app’s usefulness, its convenient features, and the
                                simplicity of your app’s UI/UX amongst other important parameters. Attractive
                                and appealing screenshots have been proven to enhance app downloads by as much
                                as 30%.</p>

                            <h3 id="11">Add A Demonstration Video If Possible</h3>
                            <p>A demo video on how to install and use your app will really simplify life for
                                your potential users. Such videos will convince your target audience on the
                                usefulness and simplicity of your app. </p>
                            <p>In the US, 85% of smartphone users prefer to download apps that have a demo video
                                on them. The App Store as well as Play Store permit demo videos upto 30 seconds
                                long. These days videos have a big impact on people on anything. </p>

                            <h3 id="12">Your App Needs To Have An Attractive And Relevant Icon</h3>
                            <p>Having an attractive icon for your official app is almost as important as having
                                a catchy name for the app and having a compelling description for the app. You
                                must select the most suitable color, design, shape, and size for your app’s icon
                                to make a highly positive visual impression on your target audience. </p>
                            <p>A meaningful and attractive icon for your app will create a good impression in
                                the minds of your target audience. It will speak volumes about your company’s
                                technical expertise, professionalism, and professional ethics. </p>
                            <p>If you’re designing a hybrid app, you must be mindful of the app stores’ minimum
                                icon size requirements. The minimum icon size requirement of The App Store is
                                1024 * 1024 pixels and the minimum icon size requirement of Play Store is 512 *
                                512 pixels. Therefore, the minimum icon size of hybrid apps must be 1024 * 1024
                                pixels to become eligible to be listed on The App Store as well.</p>

                            <h3 id="13">Acquire Many Positive Customer Reviews</h3>
                            <p>You must design your official app in such a way that your customers’ needs are
                                fulfilled and the app performs upto their expectations. Your app must be
                                sophisticated, versatile, yet simple to navigate and use. If that is the case,
                                your official app will get many downloads and positive customer reviews. </p>

                            <p>Research has shown that 90% of smartphone users check an app’s average rating
                                before they download the app. The average rating of an app must be at least 3.5
