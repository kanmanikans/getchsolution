                            <p>Every organization that can have an official website already has one or is in the process
                                of developing one to leverage the global reach and influence of the internet and to
                                improve its business in all aspects but just having an official website is not enough
                                for an organization. It must SEO optimize its official website completely to rank on the
                                first page of Google’s search results and thereby gain global visibility and website
                                traffic. If SEO optimization is not done on an organization’s official website, it’ll
                                never gain global visibility and get online traffic and so, the whole purpose of
                                building the official website will be defeated. </p>

                            <h2>The Major Components Of SEO Service</h2>
                            <p>SEO comprises of the following sub-domains or practices that help a website rank on the
                                first page of Google’s search results. They also bring organic traffic to a website and
                                increase its authenticity (DA and PA).</p>


                            <h3 id="1">Choosing The Primary And LSI Keywords</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the most important processes in SEO because choosing the right primary and
                                LSI keywords can make the difference between your website ranking on Google and getting
                                organic traffic or not ranking on Google and being wasted. </p>
                            <p>Keywords are words or phrases that people use to search for information on Google. Every
                                keyword will have its unique organic traffic volume and competition. You must choose
                                those keywords that have a high search volume but far lower competition. Either long
                                tail keywords or short tail keywords or a few of both may meet the criteria. </p>



                            <h3 id="2">Creating High Quality Content</h3>
                            <p>This is the most important part of SEO as your website and its promotional and ranking
                                strategies are based on the content in your website. Only high-quality and SEO optimized

                            </p>
                            <p>Your content has to be relevant to your target audience, informative, concise, and
                                entertaining at the same time. Only then your readers will keep revisiting your website
                                and subscribe to it. If you’re building your website using WordPress then many SEO
                                plugins are available that aid in creating high-quality and optimized content.</p>

                            <h3 id="3">Off-Page SEO</h3>
                            <p>This process is as important as on-page SEO to rank a website in a high position on
                                Google. As the name suggests, this optimization process is done outside of your website.
                                The main part of off-page SEO is getting high-quality and relevant backlinks to your
                                website to increase your website’s DA and PA so that it is perceived as a highly genuine
                                website by Google and your readers. </p>
                            <p>Creating high-quality content on your blog posts, guest blogging, and getting backlinks
                                from related influencers are some of the popular methods employed in off-page SEO to
                                make your website rank on the first page of Google’s search results. </p>



                            <h3 id="4">Local SEO</h3>
                            <p>Not all businesses have the intention to be globally visible. Many organizations provide
                                their products or services only in certain geographical locations. Naturally, these
                                organizations optimize their official websites to appear only on local searches. </p>
                            <p>Using certain keywords (short or long tail) that are used only in your local area,
                                customizing Google Ad campaigns and your Google My Business page to appear only on local
                                searches, and listing your official address to appear only on local searches on Google
                                Maps are popular methods of employing Local SEO. </p>


                            <h2>The Importance Of SEO Services</h2>
                            <p>SEO services give the following tangible benefits to websites and make them rank on the
                                first page of Google’s search results.</p>


                            <h3 id="5">Global Visibility And Ranking On The First Page</h3>
                            <p>One of the most important and invaluable benefits of applying SEO techniques to your
                                website is that overtime, it will rank organically on the first page of Google’s search
                                results and thereby gain global visibility and a high amount of web traffic. </p>
                            <p>Ranking on the first page of Google’s search results is important for a website because
                                these days people rarely have the patience to look beyond the first Search Engine Result
                                Page (SERP). Lasting results can be obtained for your official website if appropriate
                                SEO techniques are applied on it properly.</p>



                            <h3 id="6">Increased DA And PA</h3>
                            <p>Websites that rank on the first page of Google’s search results typically have a high
                                Domain Authority (DA) and Page Authority (PA) or in Google’s terms they refer to the
                                genuineness of a website. </p>
                            <p>The higher the DA and PA of a website, the higher it’ll rank on Google. The default DA
                                and PA of a website is 1. It can be enhanced upto 100 at max. Various digital tools are
                                available to detect the DA and PA of a website. One such popular tool is Moz. </p>
                            <p>The DA and PA of a website can be augmented by getting high quality backlinks from
                                relevant sources. Getting high quality backlinks from unrelated sources will hardly
                                augment the DA and PA of a website. So, care must be taken about this fact. </p>


                            <h3 id="7">Gives A Great User Experience</h3>
                            <p>Websites that rank on the first page of Google generally have an appealing and concise
                                layout. The information presented on such websites is also easy to understand and
                                navigate through plus high ranking websites load in a giffy. Such practices create a
                                great user experience which in turn brings more readers to the websites.</p>


                            </ul>

                            <h2>Precautions To Be Taken For Your Website</h2>
                            <p>While applying appropriate SEO techniques properly to your official website will give
                                lasting results for it, certain precautions must be taken while posting content on your
                                website. They are as listed below:</p>
                            <p>Duplicate pages/content must be avoided at all costs as they’ll confuse the crawler as to
                                which blog page to display for the chosen LSI keywords. </p>
                            <p>Your official website must not contain too many videos, audio files, graphics files, or
                                multimedia files which will increase the load time of your official website. The content
                                on your website must be informative, engaging, and as concise as possible to minimize
                                the load time. Readers don’t like waiting for long for websites to load. After all, most
                                of us live a fast-paced life. </p>
                            <p>Last but not least, your website ideally should not contain any broken/invalid links as
                                they will confuse Google’s crawler, frustrate your users, and dent your website’s DA and
                                PA. At least periodically check your website for broken links and mend them.</p>
