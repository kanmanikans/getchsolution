                            <p>Owing to the global reach, popularity, and influence of the internet and mobile apps,
                                organizations that can have an official app already have one or are in the process of
                                developing one. When organizations are thinking about undertaking official mobile app
                                development, they are faced with two major choices. Should they opt for developing
                                cross-platform apps which nullify the mobile OS platform barrier or should they develop
                                native apps which have an exceptionally high performance? We’ll answer this tough
                                question in this article. So, kindly stay tuned.</p>

                            <p>Before we get to the question, let’s first understand what hybrid and native apps are.
                                Hybrid apps are those mobile apps that can run on any mobile OS (Android or iOS). The
                                structural differences between the mobile OSs do not impede the execution ability of
                                hybrid apps. Hybrid apps are coded in certain programming languages that can be executed
                                by both Android and iOS.</p>
                            <p>Hybrid apps retain at least 90% of their original source code between the mobile OS
                                platforms. Coding technologies like HTML5, Javascript, C#.net, and Dart are used to
                                design cross-platform apps. App development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, and
                                Flutter employ those coding technologies respectively. Thus hybrid apps prevent anxiety
                                for entrepreneurs and mobile app developers and business owners don’t have to worry
                                about their hybrid official apps facing any usage barrier issues.</p>
                            <p>Native apps on the other hand can only be run on the mobile OS they’re designed for i.e.,
                                either Android or iOS. Apps designed purely for the Android OS cannot run on iOS and
                                vice versa. Though native apps face mobile OS platform barriers, their speed and
                                robustness cannot be matched by hybrid apps. Thus entrepreneurs have to choose between
                                versatility and performance when developing official apps for their business.</p>

                            <h2 id="1">The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Developing Native And Hybrid Mobile
                                Applications</h2>
                            <p>The benefits and downsides of native and hybrid apps were mentioned briefly in the
                                introduction section of this article. However, now let’s have a detailed study of that.:
                            </p>

                            <h3>Advantages Of Native Apps</h3>
                            <p>Native apps give business owners and app developers quite a few significant benefits
                                which make undertaking native app development worthwhile. They are as listed below..</p>

                            <h4>High performance</h4>
                            <p> Since native apps are coded in a programming language that can be understood and
                                executed by the respective mobile OS easily, their execution is swift and hassle-free.

                                Native apps require a significantly lesser amount of source code than hybrid apps as
                                there is no OS compatibility issue. Hence, their development time and execution time are
                                considerably lesser than hybrid apps..</p>

                            <h4>Secure and reliable</h4>
                            <p>Native apps of Android and iOS are built using Kotlin and Swift coding technologies
                                respectively. They are both highly concise and secure programming languages. Hence, apps
                                that are built using those coding technologies are also highly secure, swift, and
                                reliable..
                            </p>

                            <h4>More familiar layout</h4>
                            <p>Die-hard Android or iOS users will feel more comfortable using native apps than hybrid
                                apps. This is owing to the more familiar layout and functioning of native apps. Giving a
                                good user experience is important to sell your app to more people or clients. Native
                                apps have an edge in this regard..</p>

                            <h4>Easier to add new features</h4>
                            <p>Whenever you add a new feature to native apps, you don’t have to worry about its impact
                                on the layout of the app on the other mobile OS platform as well, you only need to focus
                                on the impact of the new feature on the layout and functioning of the respective native
                                app. This will save you a lot of time to upgrade the app.

                                Since native app upgrades are implemented in the respective native coding languages like
                                Kotlin or Swift, they will also be executed faster by the respective mobile OSs..</p>
                            <h4>Highly compatible screen display</h4>
                            <p> Native apps will have an aspect ratio (ratio of screen display width to display height)
                                that is compatible with the most widely used Android or iOS smartphones (aspect ratio
                                that is compatible with the popularly used smartphones’ screen sizes). Hence, the screen
                                display and resolution will be optimum and users will have a good experience using the
                                native app.
                            <h4>Advanced personalization options</h4>
                            <p> Due to the very high compatibility of native coding technologies like Kotlin or Swift
                                with their respective OSs like Android and iOS respectively, native coding languages are
                                able to offer app developers and end users an exceptionally high degree of app
                                personalization that cannot be done on cross-platform coding technologies like C#, Dart,
                                or Javascript due to the limited compatibility with the internal architecture of Android
                                and iOS.</p>
                            Achieving the optimum aspect ratio is very hard in the case of designing hybrid apps because
                            the variation in screen sizes of Android and Apple smartphones is high. Only a handful of
                            Android and Apple smartphones have similar screen dimensions.</p>

                            <h3>Disadvantages Of Native Apps</h3>
                            <p>Developing native apps for your business does have a few noteworthy disadvantages
                                which are listed below..</p>

                            <h4>Separate official apps required for Android and iOS platforms</h4>
                            <p>Unless your goal is to only address Android or Apple smartphone users, you must
                                develop two versions of your official app to cater to the needs of more people.
                                Developing two versions of your official app will definitely take more time and
                                money than developing a cross-platform app..</p>

                            <h4>App updates need to be useful and concise</h4>
                            <p>The updates for native apps need to improve the app in significant ways but they also
                                need to be short and occupy the least possible smartphone memory space.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise, users who don’t have enough phone memory space will either keep using the
                                older version of the native app or will uninstall the app altogether. Maintaining
                                their customer base is something that native app developers need to frequently worry
                                about.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Promoting native apps on social media platforms is tedious and time-consuming</h4>
                            <p>Since most official apps have two versions of themselves (Android and iOS), promoting
                                both the app versions on appropriate social media platforms and groups is tedious
                                and time-consuming and will lead to more marketing costs, which might not suit the
                                budget of small businesses.:</p>

                            <h2 id="2">Benefits And Downsides Of Developing Hybrid Apps</h2>
                            <p>Just like native apps, hybrid apps too have their advantages and disadvantages which
                                are listed below..</p>
                            <h3>Benefits Of Developing Hybrid Apps</h3>
                            <h4>Lower app development cost and time:</h4>
                            <p>Hybrid apps can run on Android as well
                                as iOS platforms. Hence business owners can be satisfied with developing
                                only one official app. This implies that app development cost and time will
                                be around 30% lesser compared to native apps.</p>
                            <p>Promotion on relevant social media platforms and groups will also be easier and
                                quicker if an organization has only one official app. </p>
                            <h4>Work Across Multiple Platforms</h4>
                            <p>When you’re designing native apps, you’ll always have a tough choice between
                                designing apps for Android or Apple smartphones. The Android OS has a much
                                larger user base but Apple smartphone users are a lot richer, more educated,
                                spend more money on iOS apps, and are more loyal to iOS apps than Android
                                smartphone users.</p>
                            <p>Hence, business owners have to choose between acquiring a larger user base
                                or acquiring relatively lesser users who will spend more on purchasing their
                                apps. This tradeoff is absent in the case of developing hybrid apps.</p>
                            <p>Companies will not be restricted by people, geographical boundaries, or
                                mobile OS platform barriers if their official app is a cross-platform mobile
                                app. They can sell their official app to anyone, anywhere in the world,
                                using any kind of smartphone if they have a hybrid official app. This
                                enables businesses to have a far greater reach and make far more online
                                revenue and profits.</p>

                            <h4>Cost effective to build and easy to upgrade</h4>

                            <p>Since hybrid apps require coding
                                only once for both the mobile OS platforms (Android and iOS), their
                                development time is far lower than native apps that need to be coded
                                separately for their respective mobile OS platforms.</p>

                            <p>Even the addition of new features or upgradation of the app can be done only
                                once for hybrid apps but needs to be done separately for native apps. In
                                other words, hybrid apps are far easier and cost-effective to maintain than
                                native apps.</p>

                            <h3>Hybrid apps can be made available on various cloud platforms:</h3>

                            <p>Some hybrid mobile app development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, Flutter,
                                PhoneGap, etcetera can be made available on various cloud platforms as they have
                                a built-in Exchange Integration Code (EIC). This means app developers can
                                develop various kinds of hybrid apps from various cloud platforms which is
                                highly convenient for them.</p>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Downsides Of Developing Hybrid Apps</h3>

                            <p><u>Performance of hybrid apps is a shade lower than native apps:</u> Hybrid apps
                                generally perform a shade lower than native apps. This difference in
                                performance will not be noticeable if you’re running only simple
                                applications but if you’re running complex and graphics-heavy
                                applications
                                like games on your smartphone then this difference in performance will
                                become noticeable.

                                It may impact user experience negatively and in rare scenarios may even
                                lead
                                to uninstallation of the app.</p>

                            <p><u>Some desired features may become unimplementable:</u> Since hybrid apps are
                                not
                                100% compatible with any smartphone’s internal working mechanism, some
                                of
                                your desired features, especially the highly complex ones, may become
                                unimplementable.</p>
                            <p>So, you must always check the feasibility of all your desired features
                                before choosing to develop a hybrid official app. This limitation is not
                                present in native apps as they are 100% compatible with their respective
                                smartphones’ internal architectures.</p>
                            <p><u>Upgrading hybrid apps is difficult and time consuming:</u> If you need to install
                                an
                                update for your hybrid official app, its feasibility must be checked from your
                                end first and then you need approvals from the respective app stores (Play Store
                                and The App Store). This process is tedious and time-consuming which can delay
                                the release of the app update which can impact its user base negatively.

                            </p>
                            <u>3D graphics support is not up to the mark:</u> If you’re developing an app (will most
                            probably be a gaming app) that requires 3D graphical elements, then hybrid apps
                            cannot support that functionality satisfactorily.
                            </p>

                            <p>You can incorporate third party 3D graphics plugins such as Unity 3D in your
                                hybrid app to support 3D elements but their visual display and appeal might not
                                be upto your expectations. Native apps, especially iOS apps perform much better
                                in this regard.
                            </p>

                            <h2 id="3">Native Or Hybrid Apps? Which One Should You Opt For?</h2>
                            <p>Unfortunately or fortunately, there is no binary answer to that question. It all
                                depends on what type of features and functionalities you want in your official
                                app.
                                If your official app needs only simple functionalities and features like in the
                                case
                                of on-demand delivery apps, you can opt for developing a hybrid official app.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the contrary, if you plan on developing an official app with complex features
                                and
                                3D graphical elements then you’d be better advised to go for native app
                                development
                                especially, iOS app development as the Swift programming language used to
                                develop
                                native iOS apps is very robust and Apple’s smartphones have a robust and
                                efficient
                                working mechanism that can support 3D graphical elements and other complex app
                                features.</p>
                            <p>Now that you have understood the benefits and pitfalls of native and hybrid
                                applications, you might be thinking of developing an official app for your
                                business
