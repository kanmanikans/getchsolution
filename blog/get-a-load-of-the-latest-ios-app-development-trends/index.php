                            <p>Mobile apps rather than any nation’s military force rule the world today. This is because
                                mobile apps are very sophisticated and versatile, especially with the ever-evolving iOS
                                app development trends. They can be used for a variety of purposes and they help the
                                common man in almost every walk of life. Over the past decade, the mobile app technology
                                has grown leaps and bounds that has enabled the development of new types of advanced
                                mobile apps. The mobile app industry has grown exponentially over the last decade. It
                                was valued at just USD 1 billion in 2007.
                                During January 2022, it was valued at USD 9.35 trillion! This is because almost every
                                business in every industry has developed or is developing an official mobile app for
                                itself. The scenario as of today is that no matter which industry your organization is
                                in, you can develop an official mobile app for your business because mobile apps have
                                become extremely advanced, versatile, and diversified these days. In the mobile phone
                                market today, there are two major mobile OS providers.
                                One is the Android OS produced by Google and the other one is iOS produced by Apple.
                                Both these mobile OSs are capable of supporting a variety of mobile apps. In this
                                article, we’re going to have a look at what kind of mobile apps can be developed for
                                iOS, the coding technology used to build iOS apps, and the <a

                            <h2>Get A Fair Idea About The Latest Ios App Development Trends</h2>
                            <p>iOS apps are generally more advanced and fast than Android apps. They are used mostly by
                                well educated, well off, and well settled people in developed nations like the US,
                                Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Designing UIs for iOS apps is far easier than
                                designing UIs for Android apps. Additionally, staying updated with the latest iOS app
                                development trends is essential for delivering cutting-edge experiences to users.</p>
                            <p>This is owing to the relatively uniform size and configuration of iphones, ipads, and
                                other smart devices of Apple. Hence, iOS app developers can focus more on iOS app
                                features and functionalities and thereby iOS apps are generally more feature rich and
                                fast when compared to Android apps. </p>
                            <p>
                                In the following sub topics, we’re going to discuss the various types of apps that can
                                be developed for Apple’s smart devices. iOS apps are developed using the ‘Swift’ coding
                                technology which was developed by Apple in 2014.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prior to that, the programming language called ‘Objective C’ was used to develop iOS
                                apps. Swift has now replaced Objective C as the coding technology of choice to build iOS
                                apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Swift coding technology may be very robust but it’s easy to learn and is a favorite
                                among programmers. There are quite a few versions of the Swift coding technology. Among
                                them, Swift 6 is the latest and the most advanced. Following are the types of iOS apps
                                that can be developed using Swift.

                            <p>AI based apps can also be used to control electronic gadgets, electrical appliances, and
                                other devices like Alexa, Siri, Google Nest, etcetera. For example, some smart bulbs,
                                fans, and other electronic and electrical appliances can be programmed to trun off after
                                a while thanks to AI-based apps. In the realm of iOS app development trends, integrating
                                AI capabilities into these applications is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
                            <p>AI based apps can also be used to control electronic gadgets, electrical appliances, and
                                other devices like Alexa, Siri, Google Nest, etcetera. For example, some smart bulbs,
                                fans, and other electronic and electrical appliances can be programmed to trun off after
                                a while thanks to AI-based apps. </p>
                            <p>Alexa, Google Nest, etcetera are able to play your desired song thanks to their builtin
                                ML algorithms. Some robot toys and actual robots also make use of AI and ML based apps.
                                The applications of AI and ML technologies are numerous and will only grow in the
                                future. So, if you’re developing an AI based app for your business, it has plenty of
                                scope for growth.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Augmented Reality (AR) Apps</h3>
                            <p>
                                AR apps give the highest level of user engagement possible. Though the success of
                                Pokemon Go was fleeting,
                                AR apps still have a bright future and wide range of applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AR apps are presently the most extensively used in the fashion and beauty industry. They
                                enable customers to see how a certain beauty product will look on them before they
                                decide to buy it. This facility heightens customer satisfaction and retention.
                                People will get the value for their money and will not feel cheated after buying a
                                beauty product.
                            </p>


                            <h3 id="3">Internet Of Things (IoT) Apps</h3>
                            <p>
                                Intenet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices communicating with each
                                other to achieve some goal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Examples of IoT devices include traffic lights communicating with each other and
                                automatically deciding when to go red, saffron,
                                or green based on the communication made, your refrigerator communicating with your
                                mobile phone and notifying you when your groceries need to replenished, your car engine
                                communicating with your IoT app and notifying you when it needs another maintenance
                                service, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IoT apps are very advanced apps and are yet to gain traction in India but they can
                                certainly be well supported by the Swift coding technology.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="4">Cloud Based Apps</h3>
                            <p>
                                Cloud Computing platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Amazon
                                Web Service (AWS) are gaining in popularity these days due to the mobile and flexible
                                software, hardware, and platform (OS) services they offer.
                            </p>
                            <p>They enable people to do any computing task on the internet without worrying about the
                                software, OS, or hardware requirements. These days other cloud platforms are becoming
                                popular like Cloudflare, One Plus, etcetera that offer cyber security and storage as a
                                service respectively. The applications and scope for growth of cloud computing apps are
                                enormous. They definitely are promising apps to develop. Additionally, iOS app
                                development trends are also evolving rapidly, further expanding the opportunities in the
                                tech industry.</p>

                                Initially, chatbots were only used in ticket reservation, educational, and customer
                                support websites. Now, they are employed by almost every website in every niche.
                                Chatbots are useful in resolving customers’ queries and complaints.
                                They help people easily and quickly get what they want from a website. Chatbots heighten
                                customer satisfaction and retention and are very useful for any business in any
                                industry.

                            <p>
                                Described below are internationally recognized iOS app development processes. If you
                                follow them scrupulously, you will surely be able to design a top-notch iOS app that
                                will satisfy the requirements of your customers and app stores’ guidelines. Without
                                further ado, let’s dive right into the topic.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="6">Gathering Your Client’s Requirements</h3>
                            <p>
                                The successful completion of your app development project depends on whether this step
                                is done properly or not because all apps are ultimately designed for customers or
                                business clients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The app’s functional and non-functional business requirements and the budget for the app
                                have to be gathered from your client fully and accurately in order to develop the most
                                appropriate iOS app for your business client. If you manage to develop the most suitable
                                iOS app for your client, the reputation of your app development agency will grow leaps
                                and bounds.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="7">Designing The UI/UX Of The App</h3>
                            <p>
                                The more advanced, attractive, and engaging the UI/UX of your iOS app is, the more will
                                be your customer engagement and retention. Designing UIs for iOS apps is far easier when
                                compared to Android apps because iphones have a more or less uniform size and design
                                when compared to Android smartphones which have many manufacturers.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="8">Developing A Prototype Of The App</h3>
                            <p>
                                Before plunging into full-fledged iOS app development, you need to develop a prototype
                                of the iOS app that you’re going to develop. That way you can cross check if and your
                                client are on the same page regarding what needs to be done.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If any changes are required, you should make the required changes to the prototype of
                                the app and get your client’s approval before proceeding to code the entire iOS app.
                                Doing this step properly will ensure correct app development and client satisfaction.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="9">Releasing The App In The App Market</h3>
                            <p>
                                Your iOS app has to align with all of The App Store’s guidelines in order for it to be
                                successfully released into the app market. The App Store’s guidelines have to be honored
                                all the time. Any future rules violation could also result in the delisting of your iOS
                                app from The App Store. So, care must be taken in this regard.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="10">App Maintenance</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once your app is released into the app market, it has to be monitored for at least six
                                months to detect and correct any run time flaws in the app. You can also upgrade your
                                iOS app any number of times after its release. App maintenance is required to maintain
                                your customer satisfaction levels and to heighten your customer retention.
                            </p>
