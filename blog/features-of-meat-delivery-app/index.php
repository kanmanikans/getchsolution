                                features and four variants of the app that benefit both the meat delivery business as
                                well as its customers.</p>
                            <h3>Customer App</h3>
                            <p>The customer app will have the following set of sophisticated features to make the
                                process of meat ordering convenient for users.</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <li>
                                    <p><b>Easy account setup:</b>This feature enables the app users to set up an account
                                        on the app or login using their gmail or social media accounts. In the case of
                                        registration on the app, users register themselves using their mobile phone
                                        numbers or emails.</p>
                                    <p>Instead of a permanent password/registered password, registered users log in to
                                        the app using only OTPs sent to their registered mobile numbers or email ids.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Showing nearby meat stores:</b>In the case of a meat aggregator app, the meat
                                    stores and cloud kitchens in the customer’s vicinity are shown and the customer can
                                    order meat from the meat store of his choice. Nearby meat stores (meat stores within

                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/create-meat-delivery-app-like-licious/">develop
                                    an advanced meat delivery app</a> for your meat store business, you can scale up
                                your business with minimal additional infrastructure and staffing costs.</p>
                            <p>This is because the serving capacity limitations of your meat store will not come into
                                play when your delivery executives deliver the ordered meat items to your customers’
                                homes. So, you have both the serving capacity of your meat store and the vast reach of
                                your on-demand meat delivery app at your disposal.</p>

                            <h3>Handling Monetary Transactions Will Become A Breeze</h3>
                            <p>In the case of on-demand delivery apps, most of the monetary transactions are done online
                                via the respective apps. Even by that rare chance, if a customer selects Cash on
                                Delivery (CoD) payment option, they will usually have the exact change.</p>
                            <p>Even if customers don’t have the exact change for their meat orders, it’s your delivery
                                executives who’ll have to worry about it and not you. They’ll just have to be advised to
                                carry adequate change with them all the time. That’s all. Problem solved!</p>
                            <p>So, developing an on-demand meat delivery app for your meat store business will truly
                                make handling monetary transactions a breeze for you.</p>
                            <p>If you need a hi-tech meat delivery app to enable you to easily scale up your meat store
                                business, just consult with us. We have proven experience in this domain and won’t let

                            <h2 id="2">Modern Features Of Meat Delivery Apps</h2>
                            <p>A high-end on-demand meat delivery app will have the following trademark features and
                                four variants of the app that set it apart from run-of-the-mill meat delivery apps.</p>

                            <h3>Customer App</h3>
                            <p>The customer variant of a meat delivery app will have the following convenient and
                                advanced features to make placing orders for meat items a breeze for customers.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Option to select from multiple languages:</i></u>&nbsp;English is not a globally
                                understood or used language. Therefore, your on-demand meat delivery app should enable
                                your customers to select from the commonly used languages in India.</p>
                            <p>This feature will provide your customers a great deal of convenience, which in turn will
                                heighten the usage of your on-demand meat delivery app.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Simple registration process:&nbsp;</i></u>Your meat delivery app should enable your
                                customers to register on the app using only their mobile numbers or emails.</p>
                            <p>Rather than a fixed password, the OTP system of login credentials verification is much
                                more secure and desirable. The simpler your app registration process is, the more the
                                number of people who will register on it.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Showing nearby meat stores:</i></u>&nbsp;This feature is only applicable for a meat
                                aggregator business. The moment the customer opens the app, he is shown the meat stores
                                in his vicinity.</p>
                            <p>He then chooses the desired meat store and proceeds to build his order for meat items.
                                Showing the meat stores in customers’ vicinity will reduce the delivery charges for them
                                and help in augmenting brand loyalty and evangelism.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Easy order placement process:</i></u>&nbsp;Modern day meat delivery apps enable
                                customers to search for meat items by their categories or by simply typing the name of
                                the meat item in the search bar.</p>
                            <p>This reduces the order placement time for customers which they find very convenient and
                                desirable. After all, the better the user experience of your meat delivery app, the more
                                app downloads and orders you’ll get.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Live order tracking facility:</i></u>&nbsp;Via the advanced GPS feature and the
                                real-time notification feature embedded in modern day meat delivery apps, customers are
                                able to know the live status of their orders.</p>
                            <p>They are also able to track the location and movement of the respective delivery
                                executives on the meat ordering app on a real-time basis. This feature prevents anxiety
                                for customers and keeps them informed (KCI).</p>
                            <p><u><i>Varied and secure online payment options:</i></u>&nbsp;Modern day meat delivery
                                apps enable customers to pay for their meat orders via varied and secure online payment
                                options. Even a Cash on Delivery (CoD) option is available.</p>
                            <p>This feature will ensure that your customers don’t have to have the exact change with
                                them when the respective delivery executives arrive. The convenience and security
                                provided by this feature will aid in enhancing your customer retention and loyalty.</p>
                            <p><u><i>A chance to give reviews and ratings:</i></u>&nbsp;Meat delivery apps these days
                                enable customers to give their ratings and reviews on the products and services
                                delivered. This will let them voice out their appreciations, suggestions, or complaints
                                if any.</p>
                            <p>You must take their feedback positively and improve the quality of your products and
                                service. That is detrimental in maintaining the integrity of your meat delivery
                                business.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Attractive offers and loyalty programs:</i></u>&nbsp;That’s music to the ears,
                                especially as far as Indians are concerned. Many people are only interested in earning
                                and saving money these days. So, if your meat delivery app has attractive discount
                                coupons and loyalty programs listed on it, it will heighten your customer retention and
                                brand loyalty.</p>


                            <h3>Delivery Executive App</h3>
                            <p>The delivery app will have features that help delivery executives correctly execute their
                                orders and coordinate with customers if needed.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Personal details registration while signing up:</i></u>&nbsp;All the personal
                                details of your delivery executives like their name, contact number, emergency contact
                                number, blood group, address, etcetera need to be registered on the delivery app to
                                provide your delivery executives or their families any form of assistance in the event
                                of your delivery executives meeting with an accident.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Option to accept or reject order:&nbsp;</i></u>Your delivery app should enable your
                                delivery executives to accept or reject your customers’ meat orders, depending on their
                                availability. Incorporating this feature will ensure that the morale and enthusiasm of

                                be embedded on the delivery app to enable your delivery executives to precisely navigate
                                to their customers’ locations and deliver their orders. This feature is vital to
                                safeguarding the integrity of your on-demand meat delivery business.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Call and chat option:&nbsp;</i></u>In case your delivery executives encounter any
                                hassles during the course of order delivery, they need to be able to call the respective
                                customers or chat with them via the delivery app and get their ambiguities or issues
                                resolved.</p>

                                to rate their respective customers and give feedback on their behavior towards them
                                because sometimes even customers mistreat delivery executives.</p>

                            <h3>Store Manager App</h3>
                            <p>The store manager app should have versatile features that enable your meat store managers
                                to handle all their business operations seamlessly and swiftly. Only if your business
                                operations run smoothly, the reputation of your meat delivery business can be
                                maintained. This app variant will only be developed if you run meat store chains.</p>

                                their wages on time. This will keep the staff in high spirits and prevent protests which
