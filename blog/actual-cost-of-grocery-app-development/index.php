                            <h2>How Do Online Grocery Stores Make Money For Your Business Growth?</h2>
                            <p>There are diverse monetization models to help you make money from an on-demand grocery
                                app. Here are a few:</p>

                            <h3>Delivery Charges</h3>
                            <p>These are one the extra charges that can improve your revenue. For some apps, the
                                delivery cost is virtually zero, while others may charge some cash for the delivery
                                procedures. While some individuals believe that this charge may hamper the development
                                and growth of their business, it is quite an effective revenue-generating option.
                            </p>


                            <h3>Subscription Model</h3>
                            <p>The primary benefit of adopting this model is that you can project your revenue and start
                                budgeting your investment and techs to integrate into your app. You can find this model
                                in an app like InstaCart which requires a meager $9.99 and an even cheaper $99.99 per
                                annum. You may either adopt a yearly or monthly subscription basis.</p>

                            <h3>Commission Fee</h3>
                            <p>Another way to earn from the grocery delivery app is representing stores on the app and
                                charging commission for every sale they make. Considering the supply and demand chain,
                                you may also charge varying commission rates on diverse products or depending on a
                                specific region.</p>

                            <h3>Premium Advertisement</h3>
                            <p>Generate extra income by allowing stores to pay an additional amount to boost their
                                visibility on search pages and home pages. You can do this by adopting a subscription
                                model or a one-off approach. Note that the ad placement doesn’t have to match with the
                                theme of your app – you can make the option available for other niches as well.</p>

                            <h2>Hours & Cost to Build a Grocery Delivery App Like Instacart, BigBasket</h2>
                            <p>Are you wondering, how much does it cost to build a grocery delivery app? In this
                                section, we will cover a rough estimate in hours for how much a grocery app development
                                will cost you.</p>
                            <p>India: $10 to $50 per hour</p>
                            <p>Qatar: $30 to $90 per hour</p>
                            <p>U.S: $50 to $200 per hour</p>

                            <p>The app discovery phase, where you put your application ideas on paper can take roughly
                                up to 3 hours. It is the most critical stage and a foundation that determines the
                                longevity and sustainability of the project.</p>
                            <p>Next is the idea validation stage which could take up to 5 hours, followed by 10 hours of
                                visuals prototyping. Going forward, you’d need to document the idea which could take up
                                to roughly 9 hours as well.</p>
                            <p>Now, here’s where the work begins. The UI/UX design, depending on a range of factors
                                could take up to 10-20 hours. The more technical part of the entire process is
                                developing the app for various operating systems. Typically, iOS development would take
                                you about 700 to 1000 hours while android development ranges from 400 to 900 hours. The
                                backend and admin panel development could last for 300 and 60 hours respectively.
                                Lastly, the testing, debugging, and a quality check will require about 50 hours.</p>
