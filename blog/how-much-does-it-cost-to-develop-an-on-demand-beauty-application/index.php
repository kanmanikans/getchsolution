                            <h2 id="1" >5 Factors That Determine The Cost Of Beauty On-Demand App Development</h2>
                            <h3>1. Platform:
                            </h3>

                            <p>The on-demand beauty app development cost is highly dependent upon the platform you
                                choose to develop your app. If you are planning to launch an Android app, you will have
                                to pay a one-time charge of $150. Whereas the iOS developers need to purchase an annual
                                membership of $99, which is mandatory for uploading the app to the App Store.
                            </p>

                            <h3>2. Features And Functionality:
                            </h3>
                            <p>The more features and functionality you want to add to your app, the more you will have
                                to pay your developer. This also depends on the type of app you want to develop. For
                                example, if you want to build a simple booking app, then it will cost less than an app
                                that connects users with stylists in real time.
                            </p>

                            <h3>3. Frontend And Backend:</h3>

                            <p> The front end of the app consists of all the functionalities that the user can see and
                                use. Whereas the backend of the app consists of all the functionalities that make the
                                app.
                            </p>

                            <h3>4. Design Complexity:
                            </h3>

                            <p>The UI/UX design of an app can be a major factor in determining the total cost of beauty
                                app development. A captivating, straightforward design that performs smoothly can
                                require multiple rounds of testing, adding to the price tag. An interactive user
                                interface is the preferred option, as it encourages user retention and amplifies
                                engagement.

                            </h3>

                            <p>If you’d like your development team to create an on-demand beauty app, you can include
                                the wireframing costs in the total price. Wireframing is essentially a blueprint of the
                                software development process, and requires a variety of tools such as Figma, PhotoShop,
                                and more, adding up to the total cost. The wireframing cost of such an app usually
                                varies between $500 to $3,000.

                            </p>

                            <p>Each of these app versions will have its own unique set of features, which will
                                contribute to the overall cost of developing a beauty service app.
