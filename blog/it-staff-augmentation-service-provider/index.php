                            <p>The corporate environment is highly dynamic and ever changing. IT firms in all nations
                                face ever new project requirements. If all those IT firms were to hire full time
                                developers to meet their interim project requirements, it would cost those firms a lot
                                of money and the newly hired developers would not be required after the completion of
                                the interim projects. Hence, the new trend for IT firms around the world is to contract
                                developers from staff augmentation service providers.</p>

                            <h2 id="1">How do I choose a good staff augmentation service provider company?</h3>
                                <p>Your Resource Augmentation (RA) service provider is the organization that’s going to
                                    execute your interim project. Hence, you must take all the necessary precautions to
                                    ensure that your team augmentation service provider is genuine and established in
                                    the industry. The parameters to be checked before entering into a contract with a
                                    team augmentation service provider are as follows.</p>
                                <h3>The Skillset, Experience, And Commitment Of The Software Developers</h3>
                                <p>You must visit the Resource Augmentation company in person and interact with their
                                    staff. Only then you’ll get to know for certain, the skill level, commitment, and
                                    experience of their staff. You must also check if the staff have the required skill
                                    sets to complete your transient project successfully.</p>
                                <p>You can assign the staff the prototype of your required software to develop. If they
                                    do a fine job with it, you can go ahead and enter into a contract with the resource
                                    augmentation service provider.</p>
                                <h3>Their Hourly Charge</h3>
                                <p>The team augmentation service provider must charge considerably lesser than if you
                                    were to hire full time software developers. Only then it makes sense to enter into a
                                    contract with the Resource Augmentation firm.</p>
                                <p>Cost effectiveness and flexibility of the contracted team size are two of the major
                                    parameters to consider before hiring an Resource Augmentation service provider.</p>
                                <h3>Go Through Their Project Execution Portfolio And Client Reviews</h3>
                                <p>You must visit the Resource Augmentation firm’s official website and read their
                                    project execution portfolio. Only if they have completed at least a few client
                                    projects successfully, should you consider entering into a contract with them.</p>
                                <p>You can also go through their clients’ testimonials and see what their ex-clients
                                    have said about their project work. This is another fool-proof way to verify the
                                    genuineness of the technocrats augmentation service provider.</p>
                                <h3>Verify The Organization’s Culture</h3>
                                <p>The RA firm must have internationally recommended and a conducive work culture. It
                                    must give its staff the right amount of liberty so that their creativity can be
                                    utilized constructively. Organizations that follow a strict management directive
                                    implementation culture tend to have disgruntled staff over time.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, those rare organizations that give full freedom to their employees
                                    with little to no project supervision tend to get varied performances. Sometimes,
                                    their clients’ projects are executed marvelously and innovatively but at other times
                                    their clients’ projects are totally messed up due to lack of uniform software
                                    development techniques.</p>
                                <p>So, you must ensure that the team augmentation service provider you intend to enter
                                    into a contract with has the optimal and conducive work culture and business
                                    environment so that you get the desired results for your interim project.</p>
                                <h3>Ensure That An Understandable Medium Of Communication Is Employed</h3>
                                <p>The Resource Augmentation organization must employ a medium of communication that you
                                    understand very well lest it will become very difficult to coordinate with them and
                                    coordination is vital to the perfect execution of your project.</p>
                                <h2 id="2">The Significant Conveniences And Benefits Of Team Augmentation Services</h2>
                                <p>Staff augmentation services offer a few important conveniences and benefits to IT
                                    organizations which are as given below.</p>
                                <h3>Cost Effectiveness</h3>
                                <p>Both in the short and long term, availing team augmentation services is
                                    cost-effective for IT firms. As mentioned before, if an IT firm were to hire full
                                    time developers to meet its interim project requirements, it would cost the IT firm
                                    a lot of money and the newly hired developers would not be required after the
                                    completion of the project.</p>
                                <p>Another disadvantage of hiring full time developers is that their salaries and
                                    incentives have to be paid on time irrespective of the successful completion of your
                                    project but that’s not the scenario if you enter into a contract with a reputed
                                    project management team augmentation service provider.</p>
                                <p>You’ll need to pay your team augmentation service provider only if your interim
                                    project is completed to your satisfaction. This contractual condition eradicates
                                    anxiety and vainful expenditure for IT firms and almost guarantees the successful
                                    completion of their interim projects.</p>
                                <h3>Flexible Team Size And Talent</h3>
                                <p>The size of the contracted team and the type of skilled labor in your contracted team
                                    can be expanded or cut down in accordance with your dynamic project requirements
                                    unlike in the case of hiring full time employees where they cannot be sacked without
                                    any concrete reasons (like performance based issues or behavioral issues).</p>
                                <p>During the course of a project, different skill sets may be required for the
                                    execution of the project. Contracting resources from a team augmentation agency
                                    makes it easy and cost-effective for an organization to add new skilled resources to
                                    their team doing the project or remove used ones to suit their current project
                                    requirements.</p>
                                <h3>Complete Transparency And Flexibility In Operations</h3>
                                <p>Unlike outsourcing your project, the programmers augmentation service provider is
                                    bound by the contract signed to keep you periodically updated on the progress of
                                    your project. You can also introduce new requirements during the project execution
                                    period unlike in outsourced projects. In short, availing team augmentation services
                                    provides more transparency and flexibility than outsourcing software development
                                    projects.</p>
                                <h3>Maximum Productivity And Availability Of Resources</h3>
                                <p>Full time programmers of an IT firm are likely to be deeply involved in the company’s
                                    internal politics and may occasionally oppose the ideas or directives of their
                                    management.</p>
                                <p>These risks do not come into play in your contracted team. The contracted resources
                                    will try to fulfill your project’s deliverables without feeling the need to be
                                    involved in your company’s internal affairs. Hence, the productivity of your
                                    contracted team will be high.</p>
                                <p>Attrition is another serious issue that IT firms face these days because as IT
                                    professionals become more skilled, they will most likely look for better
                                    opportunities. Hence, most IT professionals these days “jump” from one IT firm to
                                    another after completing just two to three years of service in an IT company.</p>
                                <p>This problem is not faced when contracting skilled resources from a renowned project
                                    team augmentation service provider. The resources will be temporarily provided every
                                    time you have a project at hand. So, you don’t have to waste a lot of time looking
                                    for replacements for your full time programmers who have quit your company.</p>
                                <p>The team augmentation service provider will ensure that your contracted team has
                                    adequate skilled resources at any point in time. The contracted resources will also
                                    most likely be experienced and thereby would not require any training. This practice
                                    will take a lot of burden off your shoulders and help you concentrate in the
                                    successful execution of your interim project.</p>
