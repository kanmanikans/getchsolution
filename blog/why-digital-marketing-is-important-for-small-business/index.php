                            <p>Until about a decade ago, only established firms in any industry were able to nationally
                                or globally advertise their services or products via traditional means of advertising
                                like giving TV ads, radio ads, billboard ads, distributing flyers, sticking posters,
                                giving newspaper ads, etcetera. </p>
                            <p>This is because traditional means of advertising are expensive and only large
                                corporations were able to afford it at that time. Digital Marketing enables startups and
                                small businesses in every industry to precisely reach out to their target audience and
                                effectively advertise their products or services.</p>
                            <p>Digital Marketing ad campaigns can be done free of cost or a company can choose to
                                undertake <a

                                social media platforms cost only a small fraction of the cost that traditional means of
                                advertising would cost. </p>
                            <p>Thus companies of all sizes can cost-effectively and effectively reach out to and engage
                                with their target audience by employing digital Marketing techniques and best practices
                                and in conclusion, Digital Marketing creates a level playing field for businesses of all
                                sizes in every industry and enables even startups and small businesses in every industry
                                to seriously compete with established firms. offering significant advantages of digital
                                marketing for local businesses.</p>

                            <p>Via various Digital Marketing practices like Social Media Marketing (SMM) and email
                                marketing, companies can send personalized messages to their leads to heighten their
                                lead conversion rate. Personally engaging with your target audience is not possible via
                                traditional means of advertisement. </p>
                            <p>Various Digital Marketing tools like Lusha, Leadfeeder, Prospect.io, Hunter.io, etcetera
                                are now available to automatically capture the contact details of your leads and send

                            <h3 id="3">Enables You To Accurately Identify And Reach Out To Your Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>By browsing through, filtering, and joining appropriate groups on various social media
                                platforms and by using various digital lead details gathering tools, you can correctly
                                identify and reach out to your target audience. The benefits of digital marketing for

                            </p>
                            <p>When you give ads on traditional mediums like newspapers, radio, flyers, posters,
                                etcetera, you’ll be reaching out to even irrelevant people and there’s no way you can
                                measure and optimize the performance of traditional ads. Giving traditional ads is like
                                groping in the dark to enhance your brand awareness, business volume, and frofits.</p>
                            <p>Digital ads are more precise, a lot less labor intensive, quicker to implement, have a
                                far greater reach, a lot more personalized, a lot more measurable and optimizable than
                                traditional ads. </p>
                            <p>Social media platforms and emails enable sending personalized messages to one’s leads and
                                therefore Digital Marketing practices have a far higher conversion rate than traditional
                                ads.</p>

                                “cool” by their peers. Hence, mobile phones are trending these days and Digital
