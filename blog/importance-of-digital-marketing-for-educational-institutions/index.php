                                more quick, effortless, and effective, yet more cost-effective than traditional means of
                                advertising. The benefits of digital marketing for educational institutions include
                                reaching a wider student base, engaging with prospects in real-time, and optimizing

                                influence. Moreover, it is quite costly to undertake, and the performance of ads given
                                via traditional means cannot be measured and optimized, unlike digital ads.</p>
                            <p>Tech giants like Google and Facebook have online ad campaign management tools like Google

                                budget for each of the keywords they use in their online ad campaigns. Once the budget
                                balance for a keyword reduces and reaches nil, the keyword is delisted from the online
                                ad campaign.</p>
                            <p>Online tools like Google Ads, Google Analytics, and CBO help users to measure and
                                optimize the performance of their online ad campaigns. For example, they can remove
                                non-performing keywords in their online ad campaigns and allocate that same budget for
                                another promising keyword as they see fit. </p>
                            <p>Research has shown that companies earn much more or achieve their targets more easily via
