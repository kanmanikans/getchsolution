                            <p>Every business wants to make itself known among its target audience or potential clients.
                                It’s the only way an organisation can expand its sales or services and make more revenue
                                and profits. When comparing digital marketing vs traditional marketing, there are two
                                main ways to do this. One method is <a

                                    Marketing techniques</a> and practices, and the other involves undertaking
                                traditional marketing methods. But which of the two approaches is advisable for a
                                business, and also the advantages of digital marketing over traditional marketing are
                                discussed below.
                                .</p>

                            <h2>What Are The Traditional Marketing Methods?</h2>
                            <p>Traditional marketing primarily involves advertising your brand via offline means like TV
                                ads, newspaper ads, billboard ads, etcetera. Traditional marketing methods are still
                                relevant in today’s digital world because a significant portion of the world’s
                                population still does not have access to the internet or mobile apps. They obtain
                                information from traditional means like newspapers, radio, TV (mostly analog TV),
                                posters, etcetera.</p>
                            <p>In these traditional mediums, which are part of traditional marketing methods, the ads
                                are displayed in a large and eye-catching manner, like on newspapers, billboards, and
                                signboards. Alternatively, they are displayed in places that a large number of people
                                frequently visit, like on sub-urban and metro trains, airports, public transportation
                                buses, railway stations, taxis, etcetera. </p>
                            <p>By displaying your ad in places that a large number of people frequently visit, you
                                increase your ad conversion rate. Traditional marketing comprises of the following
                                methods.</p>
                            <h3 id="1">Flyers</h3>
                            <p>A flyer is a piece of paper on which some ad material is printed. Flyers are usually
                                printed on A3 or A4 sheets. Flyers have a short and catchy ad text on them and a
                                colourful background.</p>
                            <p>Some people may immediately dispose off the flyers handed over to them, some people may
                                store it for later reference and use, and very few people will take immediate action on
                                it. Flyers generally have a low conversion rate. </p>
                            <p>Your flyer needs to address some pressing requirements of people (by selling your
                                products or services) or have some highly attractive offer for people to take immediate
                                action on it. </p>
                            <h3 id="2">Billboards</h3>
                            <p>Generally, companies that have a large budget for their ad campaigns opt for this form of
                                traditional advertisement. Billboards are capable of displaying one or more ads
                                pertaining to one or more brands. </p>
                            <p>Billboards are usually found on highways, near railway routes between stations, near busy
                                traffic junctions, and enroute to airports. Since billboards are huge, they’re hard to
                                miss, and usually catch people’s attention. </p>
                            <p>Billboard ads usually have a big impact on people and have a relatively high conversion
                                rate. They are also the most expensive among all forms of advertisements. So,
                                organizations should be sure of getting high ROI before they opt for billboard ads.</p>
                            <h3 id="3">Post Mail</h3>
                            <p>Here the company’s ad is printed on a piece of paper (usually A3 or A4) and sent to the
                                target audience by post mail. Sometimes, a sample of the company’s products are sent via
                                courier service to promising leads to heighten the lead conversion rate.</p>
                            <h3 id="4">Newspaper And Magazine Ads</h3>
                            <p>This is the most popular form of Traditional Marketing because even highly educated and
                                rich people living in metropolitan cities read newspapers and magazines till date. </p>
                            <p>Giving attractive and catchy ads on the front page of popular newspapers and magazines
                                will usually bring you a high conversion rate and ROI. Therefore you have to put the
                                maximum possible effort in creating appealing and attractive newspaper and magazine ads.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="5">Advertising Directly Or Indirectly By Hosting A Public Official Event In A Public
                                Forum</h3>
                            <p>If your company offers some unique or rare products or services, you can host public
                                seminars, conventions, or conferences in public forums like malls and setup poster or
                                signboard ads to advertise your business’s unique and useful products or services. </p>
                            <p>People almost never miss and are impacted deeply by public events hosted on public forums
                                like malls, auditoriums, stadiums, shopping complexes, etcetera. So, this form of
                                traditional advertising will be very effective and give you very high ROI provided your
                                company offers some unique or uncommon products or services.</p>
                            <h3 id="6">Word Of Mouth Or Referral</h3>
                            <p>If some of your customers are highly satisfied with your products or service, you can
                                track and reach out to them by calling them or sending letters and request them to
                                spread the word of your brand. </p>
                            <p>Needless to say that you need to provide your existing customers with attractive
                                incentives to make them do the job as nobody works for free these days. Once, you have
                                successfully converted your existing customers into your brand evangelists, they will
                                provide your business with multidimensional benefits in the long run. </p>
                            <p>Word of mouth recommendation or referral is very effective and relevant even to this day
                                because people trust their friends, neighbors, and colleagues more than they trust
                                celebrity ads or any other form of traditional or digital advertising.</p>
                            <h3 id="7">Radio And TV Ads</h3>
                            <p>Even to this day, there are still a large number of people who watch tv (even analog TV)
                                and listen to the radio or podcasts. Hence, such means of traditional advertisements are
                                still impactful and relevant. </p>
                            <p>You must either employ any celebrity advertising your brand or the person advertising
                                your brand must be a very impactful speaker or your ad has to be designed in an
                                innovative and impactful manner to make people listen to it with interest and take the
                                desired action. </p>
                            <p>Many popular brands like Bisleri, Fevicol, Fevistick, Monster.com, Union Bank, etcetera
                                have employed very innovative ads recently to create a big impact on people and heighten
                                their conversion rates.</p>
                            <h3 id="8">Cold Calling</h3>
                            <p>This is the most elaborate and the least effective form of traditional advertising.
                                Examples of this form of advertising include banks and insurance companies calling
                                random people and asking them if they are in immediate need of loans or insurance
                                policies respectively. Mostly you’ll end up calling uninterested people and irritating
                                them.</p>
                            <p>There are also those lucky times when you’ll call an interested prospect. The main
                                advantage of this form of marketing is that you get a chance to build a close rapport
                                with your interested prospects, who could later on become your customers and even your
                                brand’s evangelists.</p>
                            <h2>Understanding The Meaning And Sub Domains Of Digital Marketing</h2>

                                advertised products.</p>
                            <p>Rather than doing it alone, you can tie up with popular and relevant influencers on
                                various social media platforms (particularly Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) to gain a
                                great degree of traction, influence, and heighten your sales.</p>
                            <h3 id="15">App Store Optimization (ASO)</h3>
                            <p>The internet does have a global reach and websites are definitely popular but netizens
                                and millennials these days prefer using mobile phones and apps as they are handy and
                                portable. </p>
                            <p>Hence, it would be preferable if you developed a mobile app for your business as it would
                                greatly enhance your reach, business volume, sales, and profits. </p>
                            <p>Just like websites, even mobile apps have to be perfectly optimized to rank on app stores
                                and appear in users’ searches for them to download your official app. This process is
                                known as App Store Optimization (ASO).</p>
                            <h2>The Noteworthy Advantages Of Online Marketing Over Traditional Marketing</h2>
                            <p>Comparing digital marketing vs traditional marketing, let’s see the advantages of digital
                                marketing over traditional marketing. Online Marketingwill be the go-to marketing
                                technique for organizations. They are as mentioned below.</p>
                            <h3 id="16">Relevant Audience Targeting</h3>
                            <p>When you adopt any means of traditional advertising, you cannot help reaching
                                inappropriate and uninterested people.</p>
                            <p>For example, let’s say you gave an ad on a popular newspaper brand in your locality or
                                nation and let’s assume it’s about a shaving blade, even kids and women in your
                                locality, state, and nation will see the ad and be unimpacted. </p>
                            <p>In other words, you’ll be spending money in reaching people who aren’t even your target
                                audience. Even if interested prospects see your ad, there’s no way you can get to know
                                about it and reach out to them. You won’t know how many relevant people have seen your
                                newspaper ad and among them, how many have actually been impressed and bought your
                                shaving blades. </p>
                            <p>Digital Marketing techniques on the other hand enable you to create targeted paid ad
                                campaigns on Google and various social media platforms. Various ad campaign management
                                tools are available that enable you to measure and fine tune the performance of your
                                paid ad campaigns on Google and various social media platforms. </p>
                            <p>The advantages of online marketing over traditional marketing are clearly reflected in
                                the fact that the cost to create and launch a paid ad campaign on various online
                                platforms will be far lower than traditional means, and every penny of your online paid
                                ad campaign will be well-spent and give you the desired results.</p>
                            <h3 id="17">Global Reach And Influence</h3>
                            <p>Any form of traditional advertising will only have a local impact at best but websites
                                and social media platforms can help you make your brand known globally. You will also be
                                able to explicitly reach and influence your target audience. </p>
                            <p>If you have an <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/digital-marketing/seo-company/">official
                                    website that’s 100% SEO optimized</a> then it’ll automatically be listed on the
                                first page of Google’s search results and you won’t even have to spend money on running
                                social media ad campaigns as your brand will be visible globally.</p>
                            <h3 id="18">Highly Engaging</h3>
                            <p>Digital Marketing enables you to reach out precisely to your target audience unlike
                                Traditional Marketing and engage with them effectively. </p>
                            <p>You can write personalized emails, create social media posts that have multimedia content
                                in them to make them more engaging, create opinion polls or doodles related to your
                                products or services, create an appealing online poster ad or infographics, create your
                                brand’s business page on appropriate social media groups and platforms to promote your
                                business, etcetera to make a big impact on your target audience. </p>
                            <p>Unlike traditional forms of marketing, Digital Marketing techniques can create a large
                                follower base and brand loyalty for a business as in the cases of Coke, Britania, Pepsi,
                                Amaron, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Lakme, etcetera. The advantages of online marketing over
                                traditional marketing include the ability to target specific audiences with precision
                                and the potential for real-time interaction and engagement.</p>
                            <p>It’s only on social media platforms and groups that your customers or brand evangelists
                                can share your ad posts and help spread the word of your brand. This is not possible via
                                traditional means of advertising.</p>
                            <h3 id="19">Very Cost Effective</h3>
                            <p>Apart from being accurate in making you reach the right target audience, Digital
                                Marketing techniques are also very cost effective to implement. You can promote your
                                brand on relevant social media platforms and groups free of charge. You can even
                                allocate a budget that suits your pocket for your social media ad campaigns.</p>
                            <p>Traditional Marketing techniques on the other hand are highly expensive, inaccurate, not
                                quantifiable and optimizable. Given below are the cost ranges for various forms of
                                traditional advertising. You will be able to see how expensive they are and why they are
                                usually meant only for established businesses.</p>
                            <p><i>Billboard ads:</i> These ads cost between USD 1,500 to USD 15,000 to implement. It is
                                the most expensive form of traditional advertisement. </p>
                            <p><i>Full page newspaper ad:</i> The cost to give a full-page newspaper ad varies widely
                                depending on which newspaper you want to give an ad on.</p>
                            <p>A full-page newspaper ad would only cost between USD 2,000 to USD 3,000 on a local (town)
                                newspaper. The same would cost between USD 100,000 to USD 200,000 on the Washington
                                post. This is owing to the vastly varied reach and influence of the different newspaper
                                brands.</p>
                            <p><i>30 seconds radio ads:</i> This form of advertising is especially effective in rural
                                areas of developing and developed countries. Radio ads can cost anywhere between USD
                                1,000 to USD 8,000 to implement. </p>
                            <p>Advantages of online marketing over traditional marketing are evident, as paid ad
                                campaigns on various social media platforms and paid Google ads cost only between USD
                                100 to USD 4,000 per month. In stark contrast to the above-mentioned costs, paid ad
                                campaigns on various social media platforms and paid Google ads cost only between USD
                                100 to USD 4,000 per month and the performance of such digital ad campaigns can be
                                quantified and optimized unlike traditional ads.</p>
