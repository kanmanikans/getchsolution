                            <p>Android vs iOS is a clash of titans. Both these mobile operating systems are highly
                                popular and have a large user base. We have to examine a number of factors before
                                deciding which of them is the better choice to use as a platform to launch your mobile
                                app. Without further ado, let’s dive into the topic.</p>

                            <h2 id="1">How The Android OS Emerged At The Top</h2>
                            <p>The Android mobile OS platform was founded in October, 2003. It was founded by Palo Alto,
                                California. Rich Miner, Nick Sears, Chris White, and Andy Rubin. The primary purpose of
                                developing the Android OS was to incorporate the GPS feature in it so that people’s
                                mobile phones could track the owner’s location.</p>
                            <p>Later, in the eventful year of 2005, the tech behemoth Google had acquired Android. It
                                decided to use the Linux coding technology to make the Android OS more sophisticated
                                step by step. Adopting Linux as the coding technology for the Android OS enabled Google
                                to make the OS development project, an open-source one.</p>
                            <p>As a result, in a very short period of time, a plethora of advanced versions of the
                                Android OS were developed and released into the market. Many useful apps were developed
                                to make them compatible with Android.</p>
                            <p>Today, the only serious competitor for the Android OS is Apple’s iOS. Even that is a
                                distant second to Android with iOS having only 29.49% market share. Android on the other
                                hand has a whopping 69.74% of the market share of mobile OSs. The Windows OS has become
                                almost obsolete with only 0.77% of the market share of mobile OSs. Android had
                                eliminated its former competitors like BlackBerry, Palm OS, Web OS, etcetera before
                                emerging at the top spot among the most used mobile OSs.</p>
                            <p>Today, Android 12 is the latest version of the Android OS. Google had undertaken an
                                ambitious project called “Fuchsia” in 2019 to make an Android OS version that could
                                support all types of apps, including apps meant for the iOS and Windows OS so that
                                people do not even have to think about buying an iPhone, an iPad, a Windows smartphone,
                                a desktop, or a even a laptop.</p>
                            <p>If the “Fuchsia” version of the Android OS is released successfully in the market, it
                                could unhinge all of its competitors unless they come up with such an advanced
                                cross-platform mobile OS soon.</p>
                            <p>Sadly, Google has kept people in the dark regarding the progress in the development of
                                the Fuchsia version of the Android OS. It is amazing that Google is still embarked on
                                the development of the Android OS despite having released many advanced versions of it.

                            <h2 id="2">Why Organizations Prefer Android App For Business Applications</h2>
                            <p>The <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/top-android-app-development-trends-in-2022/">trend
                                    over android application</a> is increased day by day. Even though the iOS is capable
                                of
                                supporting complex and advanced mobile applications of all types, organizations prefer
                                to
                                develop Android apps for their business applications or product (app) releases because
                                Android smartphones and the Android OS variants offer some key advantages over iOS.
                                Let’s
                                have a look at them below.</p>
                            <h3>Much Better Value For Money</h3>
                            <p>Android apps are just as sophisticated as their iOS counterparts but they can be
                                developed at almost half the price. Android phones are also as advanced (have advanced
                                configurations) as iPhones but don’t cost as much.</p>
                            <p>Even economical Android smartphones that cost less than USD 250 like the Moto G5 Plus
                                have broad screens (5.2 inches), high definition rear cameras (12 MP), advanced
                                processors (Snapdragon 625), and cost just USD 239.</p>
                            <p>An iPhone of similar configuration would cost at least USD 350 to manufacture as the
                                working mechanisms (instruction execution methods) of the iOS and the Android OS are
                                radically different.</p>
                            <h3>No Port For Earphones</h3>
                            <p>All successors of the iPhone 7 do not have audio ports to connect earphones. If one wants
                                to listen to music or any other type of audio from an iPhone, he or she has to connect a
                                Bluetooth-enabled pair of earphones or headphones or buy and connect a C-Type to USB
                                cable with the C-Type end being a Lightning Connector that’s supported by iPhones.</p>
                            <h3>Easy And Cheap Availability Of Android Phone Hardware</h3>
                            <p>Most of the Android smartphones today can quickly charge via power adapters with C-Type
                                cables. The hardware/gadgets required for Android smartphones are easily available in
                                the market and are cost-effective.</p>
                            <p>If you lose the power adapter given for your iPhone, you will find it very hard to get a
                                new one. More often than not, you’ll find yourself using a USB to C-Type cable with the
                                C-Type end being a Lightning Connector to charge your iPhone while your laptop or
                                desktop is powered on. iPhones, more often than not, require special equipments to
                                utilize all of their features. They’re not as pocket friendly as Android smartphones.
                            </p>
                            <h3>More Customization Options</h3>
                            <p>Every person is unique and people cherish that trait. Since Android smartphones give
                                multitudinous options to people to customize their mobile phone display skins and
                                widgets, people love using Android phones as it makes them feel unique and special.</p>
                            <p>iPhones on the contrary have very few customization options available, both with widgets
                                displayed on the home screen and the skin of the display. Hence, people do not get that
                                personal touch with iPhones and therefore its user base is far lower than Android
                                smartphones.</p>
                            <h3>File Transfer Is Much Easier</h3>
                            <p>To transfer files from your iPhone to your PC, you need to install and create an account
                                on iTunes on your PC. Still, you will be able to transfer only photos from your iPhone
                                to your PC. Audio and video files cannot be transferred.</p>
                            <p>If you connect your Android smartphone to your PC, it will appear as an external drive,
                                having various types of files and folders, which you can easily cut or copy and paste on
                                the desired location/s in your PC.</p>
                            <p>The OS barrier does not come into play on Android smartphones. The coupling of Android
                                smartphones with PCs will look seamless and smooth for Android smartphone users. What
                                more could one ask for?</p>
                            <h3>An All-Purpose Back Button</h3>
                            <p>The ‘back’ option/button built into all Android smartphones is usable under all
                                circumstances. You can use it within an app to return to the previous screen or process
                                or you can use it outside of apps to return to the previous screens on your smartphone.
                                You can also press and hold the back button to close some or all of your previously used
                                screens or apps.</p>
                            <h3>Multitasking On Multiple Windows</h3>
                            <p>The latest Android smartphones enable their users to do multiple tasks on multiple
                                windows/screens simultaneously. For example: you could be writing an email on one screen
                                and running a business application on another.</p>
                            <p>Multitasking on multiple windows enables users to get their work done faster. Therefore,
                                it’s no wonder that the latest Android smartphones are a hit with the masses.</p>
                            <h3>Multiple Secure Login Options</h3>
                            <p>The latest Android smartphones, especially from Samsung, offer a wide array of login
                                options to users. Users can choose from pattern, PIN, thumbprint, retinal, and
                                face-recognition login validation options.</p>

                            <h2 id="3">Is The Cost To Build An Android App Too Much Or Economical?</h2>
                            <p>If you have become convinced that developing an Android app is more worth your time than
                                developing an iOS app, you might be wondering about what is the cost to develop an
                                android app. If so, kindly read further and you will get a fair idea.</p>
                            <p>There is no concrete answer to this question as its answer depends on a multitude of
                                factors. Generally speaking, the cost to develop an android app ranges from USD 20,000
                                to USD 2.5 million.</p>
                            <p>The cost also depends on the country or continent in the world you are developing the
                                Android app from as app developers from different countries charge differently for their
                                service.</p>
                            <p>Android app developers from Europe are costlier and charge between USD 40 to USD 90 per
                                hour.</p>
                            <p>Android app developers from the USA and Australia are the costliest and will charge
                                between USD 90 to USD 150 per hour.</p>
                            <p>The overall cost to create an android app depends also on the time taken to develop the
                                app which in turn depends on the complexity of the app. A simple Android app will take
                                between 500 to 800 working hours to develop and will cost between USD 20,000 to USD
                                80,000.</p>
                            <p>A moderately complex and sophisticated Android app will take between 800 to 1,200 working
                                hours to develop and will cost between USD 90,000 to USD 1.2 million.</p>
                            <p>A state-of-the-art and fully featured Android app will take between 1200 to 2000 working
                                hours to develop and will cost between USD 1.5 million to USD 2.5 million.</p>
                            <p>The technical aspects that determine how complex an Android app is are:</p>
                            <p> <u>The type and complexity of the app:</u> Android gaming apps (like Zombie Apocalypse,
                                Call of Duty, PubG, etcetera), CRM apps, ERP apps, and E-Commerce apps are the most
                                complex and involve the most money and time to develop.
                                Simple apps like a hotel room booking app, unit converters, a scientific calculator,
                                etcetera are fairly easy to design and will cost you the least amount of time and money.
                            </p>
                            <p> <u> Graphical elements involved:</u> The more the number and sophistication of the
                                graphical elements involved, the more the cost to develop the Android app. Generally,
                                mobile games that are graphics-heavy like the NBA 2K21 are the costliest to develop.</p>
                            <p> <u>Debugging, MVP testing, and additional services:</u> An Android app (or any other app
                                for that matter) needs to be checked for runtime bugs and debugged before the MVP of the
                                app is ready. This of course is going to cost you some money.
                                If the MVP of the app is not upto your expectations, modifications will be required and
                                that of course will take time and cost you money.
                                If you need the app developers to handhold you for a few months after the release of the
                                app or provide any other type of assistance after the project is completed, that too
                                will cost you.</p>
                            <p>If you want to develop a high-end android app and want to know how much it’ll cost you,
                                simply get in touch with us and we’ll guide you every step of the way.</p>
                            <h2 id="4">Will Android Apps Still Be “Da Bomb” In The Future?</h2>
                            <p>Yes! The Android OS has been updated to such an extent by Google that it can support even
                                the most complex and advanced mobile apps. The latest version of the Android OS in the
                                market is the Android 12.</p>
                            <p>Google is trying to develop an Android OS variant that can support apps meant for any OS
                                platform, be it iOS or even Windows. The variant’s name is “Fuchsia” and is yet to be
                                released into the market. If it is successfully released into the market in the near
                                future, it can flush out its competitors like the iOS.</p>
                            <p>Both the Android OS and Android smartphones are just as advanced (if not more advanced)
                                and featured as iOS and iPhones but are a lot less expensive. Hence, users and
                                organizations will stick to using Android apps for the foreseeable future.</p>
                            <p>Apps that center around or employ the following technologies will be mostly built for the
                                Android OS now and in the future.</p>
                            <h3>AI And Machine Learning</h3>
                            <p>AI and Machine Learning technologies work best with the Android OS. These technologies
                                are the most suitable for the hardware of Android smartphones which are far more
                                cost-effective than iPhones.</p>
                            <p>AI and Machine Learning technologies are the most widely used and evolving technologies
                                these days. High-end mobile games, chatbots, business analytics apps, and language
                                learning apps use AI and Machine Learning technologies the most and are mostly built for
                                the Android OS these days.</p>
                            <h3>Internet Of Things (IoT)</h3>
                            <p>For example, your digital weighing machine and your fitness app can communicate with each
                                other using IoT technology to keep your body’s weight and fat content in check. Some
                                traffic signals can communicate with each other using IoT technology to automatically
                                and efficiently manage the flow of traffic. Your refrigerator can communicate with the
                                respective app on your mobile phone to inform you of the groceries needed.</p>
                            <p>The list of the uses of IoT is endless. It is today’s most promising technology. Since
                                the Android OS is so versatile and robust, almost all the IoT based apps in the future
                                will be designed for the Android OS.</p>
                            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
                            <p>Cryptocurrencies that employ blockchain technology are becoming increasingly popular
                                these days. Though they haven’t fulfilled their original objective of replacing
                                traditional currencies, they are widely used by people as a digital asset these days to
                                trade with and make profits.</p>
                            <p>Many popular payment gateways in India like Citrus Pay, CCAvenue, PayUBiz India,
                                Instamojo, Bill Desk, Atom, etcetera are considering including cryptocurrencies in their
                                monetary transaction service.</p>
                            <h3>Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</h3>
                            <p>Accelerated Mobile Pages is a technology invented by Google to enable mobile apps and web
                                pages to load faster. This networking technology works best with the Android OS as it is
                                swift and light on its base code.</p>
                            <p>In today’s world, speed is everything. If your app does not load fast (within a few
                                seconds), people will lose their interest and close or even uninstall your app. So,
                                mobile apps that make use of the AMP technology will be mostly Android-based in the
                                future.</p>
                            <h3>AR And VR Technologies</h3>
                            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are one of the top emerging
                                technologies of today. They are graphics-heavy technologies that require sophisticated,
                                fast, and versatile OSs to run them. The Android OS hits all the checkboxes.</p>
                            <p>Android applications are also more cost-effective to develop than iOS applications.
                                Hence, AR and VR oriented apps will be built mostly for the Android OS in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, IKEA has launched the Place app which enables customers to see a virtual 3D
                                image of their dream home and check if it’ll fit in the plot of land that they’re going
                                to buy. That way, people can make more informed land purchases.</p>
                            <p>If you need a state-of-the-art Android app that employs any of the above-mentioned
                                cutting edge technologies, simply contact us and we’ll get the job done for you.</p>
