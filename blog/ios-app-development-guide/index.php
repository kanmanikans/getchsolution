                            <p>The following industry best practices need to be followed while undertaking iOS app
                                development process so that only high-quality iOS apps are developed.</p>

                            <h3>Building A Roadmap Or Wireframe For The App</h3>
                            <p>A wireframe of an app is the roadmap to its final version. It is built taking into
                                consideration the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the business client. The
                                <a

                                The wireframe will of course undergo few or several modifications until its design and
                                functionalities satisfy the business client.</p>

                            <h3>Testing The IOS App Thoroughly</h3>
                            <p>Both the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and the final variant of the iOS app need to be
                                tested thoroughly for bugs and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to ensure that the iOS
                                app runs perfectly and efficiently. The integrity of the iOS app development process is
                                preserved by thoroughly testing it in all aspects (right from its visual design to
                                performance).</p>

                            <h3>Employing The Appropriate App Store Optimization (ASO) Techniques</h3>
                            <p>Once the final variant of the iOS app is ready, appropriate App Store Optimization (ASO)
                                techniques need to be applied on the app to make it rank on The App Store’s searches.
                                The ASO guidelines can be found on Apple’s official website.
                            </p>
                            <p>Only white-hat ASO techniques that have been approved by Apple need to be employed to get
                                lasting results and benefits. Employment of gray-hat or black-hat ASO techniques might
                                result in delisting or banning of the iOS app from The App Store.</p>

                            <h3>App Maintenance</h3>
                            <p>Even after listing the iOS app on The App Store, the app needs to be regularly checked
                                for bugs and performance issues so that if they arise, they can be fixed immediately and
                                your customers can enjoy uninterrupted high-quality service. The iOS app can even be
                                upgraded occasionally if necessary.</p>
                            <p>If you need to undertake <a

                            <h2 id="2">IOS App Development For Business Best Practices</h2>
                            <p>The following industry best practices need to be followed while designing iOS apps to
                                ensure maximum compliance with Apple’s app designing and ASO guidelines and to ensure
                                that the iOS app is listed permanently on The App Store. When considering IOS app
                                development for business, these practices become even more crucial for success.</h3>
                            <p>Only authorized app store badges should be used while embedding a CTA button in The App
                                Store where your iOS app is listed. The badges’ designs vary across iPhone, iPad, and
                                Apple TV devices.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, there are three variants of the Apple badges, namely: the preferred badge, the
                                alternative badge, and the localized badges.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The preferred badge has white text with a black background and gray outline. This is
                                    the badge that should “preferably be used” in CTA buttons.</li>
                                <li>The alternative badge has black text with a white background and gray outline. This
                                    badge can only be used if it suits your app design.</li>
                                <li>Localized badges can have the preferred badge’s layout or the alternative badge’s
                                    layout. The only difference is that they are employed in countries where English is
                                    not the national language like China, Japan, etcetera.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <br>
                            <p>The Apple badges should be used below the iOS app screenshots as they are without
                                even minor modifications to them like changing the color of their outline, modifying
                                their angle, animating them, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3>Having A Minimum Clear Space</h3>
                            <p>Minimum clear space is the area around the apple badge that needs to be clear or void
                                of images, text, graphics content, etcetera. There should just be a white background
                                around the badge that’s equivalent to a quarter of the height of the badge or 10 mm
                                or 40 pixels. This rule is enforced to enhance the display of The App Store and
                                better user experience.</p>
                            <h3>Image Usage Guidelines</h3>
                            <p>In case your iOS app can run on all of Apple’s devices like PC, iPhone, iPad, and
                                laptops, you can use Apple’s product bezels to show your app’s display/layout on all
                                the Apple devices.</p>
                            <p>You must use Apple’s product bezels as they are without adding any graphical
                                modifications like reflections, shadows, highlights, etcetera. The bezels can also
                                not be enlarged, shrunk, cropped, tilted, flipped, animated or modified in any other
                                way.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the images must fit the display cross sections of all Apple
                                devices. Your screenshot app images or other images on The App Store listing section
                                must be realistic and as they appear on your iOS app. Graphical alterations, angle
                                or position alterations, or color alterations to create a high visual impact are not
                                allowed.</p>
                            <h3>URL Address Naming</h3>
                            <p>The URL of your official website or app can include Apple’s trademark names but only
                                if the trademark names follow your company’s name.</p>
                            <p>Correct: www.company.com/app/iphone or www.company.com/ipad
                                Wrong: www.iphoneappcompany.com or www.ipadgroceryapp.com</p>
                            <h3>Advertising The Right Message</h3>
                            <p>The screenshot images and other images that you use to <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/qa/ppc-company-in-qatar/">advertise
                                    your iOS app</a> on The App Store should not convey the meaning that your
                                company has tied up with Apple in any way.</p>
                            <p>The images that you use to advertise or give details about your iOS app should also
                                not tarnish the reputation, value, and public goodwill of Apple lest your app can
                                get delisted from The App Store before long.</p>
                            <h3>Push Notification</h3>
                            <p>Your iOS app should show notifications to the user when the Apple device is locked.
                                When the user taps on the notification, he should be taken to the respective
                                location on your iOS app and not the Apple device’s home screen. Aslo, avoid showing
                                unwanted notifications while your iOS app runs as that will only irritate the user.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Status Bar Icons Display</h3>
                            <p>Your iOS app should be designed in such a way that even when it’s running, the status
                                bar icons such as battery, WiFi, current time, etcetera on the top of the screen on
                                any Apple device should be visible to the user. This feature will provide a lot of
                                conveniences and operational flexibility to the user. It will enhance the usability
                                of your iOS app.</p>
                            <h3 id="3">What is the Growth of iOS App Development in India?</h3>
                            <p>iOS apps are the most sought-after by tech savvy people. iOS apps are widely used in
                                developed countries like the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia but they are also gaining
                                popularity in developing countries like India and China. The growth of iOS App
                                Development in India is particularly noteworthy, reflecting the expanding global demand
                                for these applications.</p>
                            <p>The App Store has over 2 million iOS apps listed on it and the number keeps growing
                                every day. The current number of iPhone and iPad users worldwide is 1.8 billion and
                                growing.</p>
                            <p>iOS app developers are one of the most highly paid software professionals in the
                                world. They are now paid an average of USD 85,000/- per annum! The iOS app
                                development industry was valued at a whopping USD 1.3 trillion as of February 2021
                                (a year ago) and the industry has created over 1.5 million jobs so far.</p>
                            <p>Still, the iOS app development industry can grow a lot bigger (at least thrice as big
                                as its current size) as the programming language called Swift, used to develop iOS
                                apps was introduced by Apple only in 2014, replacing its predecessor, Objective C.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Swift programming language is easy to learn and is able to create almost bug-free and
                                fast iOS applications. It has become the go-to programming language for native iOS app
                                developers. The growth of iOS App Development in India has also seen a significant surge
                                in recent years.</p>
