                            <p>People fancy using a Cost-effective Food app rather than going to a restaurant and dining
                                or cooking at home for a number of reasons. Prominent among them are the convenience of
                                ordering food from one’s home, attractive offers and loyalty programs given, a plethora
                                of secure and swift payment options offered, and 24/7 customer support service provided.
                                Let’s have a detailed understanding of it in the coming section.</p>
                            <h3>Easy And Effortless For Customers</h3>
                            <p>Via food delivery apps, people can get the dishes that they want without leaving the
                                comfort
                                of their homes, without traveling and getting stuck in traffic jams, without waiting in
                                long
                                queues outside restaurants or even without having to cook. It saves them a lot of time,
                                money, and effort. Who wouldn’t want such numerous conveniences?</p>
                            <p>They can also browse your menu and choose their dishes in their own sweet time. Research
                                has
                                proven that the more time customers are allowed to choose their order items, the more
                                likely
                                they are to place a big order.</p>
                            <h3>Contactless Delivery Can Save Customers’ Lives</h3>
                            <p>During these pandemic times, this convenience has become the need of the hour. People are
                                averse to going to a crowded restaurant or any other crowded place due to the high risk
                                of incurring an infection. Building a food delivery app has become essential for
                                restaurants to adapt to these changing times and ensure their survival. People can just
                                request the delivery executives to leave their order at their doorsteps and sanitize
                                themselves before eating. This practice prevents human contact and thereby greatly
                                curtails the spread of the infection, making it a wise investment despite the cost to
                                build a food delivery app.</p>
                            <p>People can just request the delivery executives to leave their order at their doorsteps
                                and
                                sanitize themselves before eating. This practice prevents human contact and thereby
                                greatly
                                curtails the spread of the infection.</p>
                            <h3>No Disappointment For Customers</h3>
                            <p>Your food aggregator app will be updated on a real-time basis and clearly inform your
                                customers which food items are available and which ones are not in which restaurants.
                            </p>
                            <p>This way, your customers don’t have to go to any restaurant in person and incur the
                                chance of
                                getting disappointed if their favorite dishes or cuisine is not available in that
                                restaurant. Since the prices of food items are also mentioned on your food aggregator
                                app,
                                your customers can check their affordability before ordering.</p>
                            <h3>Live Order Status Updates</h3>
                            <p>Food aggregator apps will give live order status updates to customers once they place an
                                order. Order statuses like ‘Order received’, ‘Your food is being prepared’, ‘Your order
                                is
                                out for delivery’, ‘Order delivered’, ‘Item not available’, etcetera are updated on a
                                real-time basis.</p>

                                real-time
                                basis. This feature prevents a lot of anxiety for customers.</p>
                            <h3>Attractive Offers And Loyalty Programs</h3>
                            <p>The appealing discounts and loyalty programs offered on the Cost-effective Food app these
                                days enable people to save a lot of their money. After all, money is precious and people

                            <h3>Customer's Money Is Safely Transacted Online</h3>
                            <p>People, especially netizens, don’t like carrying a lot of cash with them these days as
                                there
                                is a danger of theft, fraudity (counterfeiting), and the necessity to have a lot of
                                change
                                with them.</p>
                            <p>Food delivery apps offer a wide array of secure and swift online payment options to
                                customers

                                and
                                should be handled with care.</p>
                            <h3>Customer's Can Reorder With The Same Preferences</h3>
                            <p>Food aggregator apps will automatically store (via machine learning technology)
                                customers’
                                past orders and their preferences so that they can order again effortlessly and
                                instantly.

                                cross-platform mobile apps and the Flutter platform employs the Dart coding technology
                                to
                                achieve the same end.</p>

                            <h2 id="3">The Efficient Business Models Of Modern Day Food Aggregator Businesses</h2>
                            <p>Modern Day Food Aggregator Businesses like Swiggy will have two main types of business
                                partners namely restaurant partners and delivery partners. They coordinate with each
                                other under certain circumstances and ensure that the food aggregator company’s business
                                operations run smoothly. Let’s now have a look in detail at their functioning.</p>
                            <h3>Restaurant Partner Model</h3>
                            <p>Certain restaurants have partnered with food aggregator firms like Swiggy to heighten
                                their
                                reach, business volume and profits. By encashing on the food aggregator firm’s user base
                                and
                                brand loyalty, partner restaurants can serve more customers without facing the drawbacks
                                of
                                their limited seating capacity and popularity.</p>
                            <p>If any restaurant is offering any trendy or unique dishes, customers get to know about it
                                via
                                the food aggregator app and order those dishes online.</p>
                            <p>The Restaurant Partner model also benefits various restaurants as they can piggyback on
                                food
                                aggregator companies’ user bases and brand loyalty to heighten their reach, business
                                volume,
                                and profits. Food aggregator companies earn commissions on the profits made by
                                restaurants
                                on their orders via food delivery apps.</p>
                            <h3>Delivery Partner Model</h3>
                            <p>Here, food aggregator companies’ delivery executives deliver customers’ orders to them.
                                They
                                earn a commission on every delivery made. Delivery executives help food aggregator firms
                                make revenue by delivering their customers’ orders thereby enabling them to earn
                                commissions
                                on the profits made by the concerned restaurants. Thus, it’s a win-win situation for
                                both
                                parties.</p>
