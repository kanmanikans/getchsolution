                            <h2 id="5">Laundry App Development Cost Estimation</h2>
                            <p>The cost to develop a laundry delivery app depends a lot on the number and complexity of the features involved. The laundry business app development cost varies widely between USD 2,000 and USD 30,000.</p>

                            <p>Developing a high-end laundry delivery app with the above-mentioned app variants will cost between USD 10,000 and USD 30,000. The exact price is influenced by factors like</p>

                            <h3>The Mobile OS For Which The App Is Designed</h3>
                            <p>Designing a laundry delivery app for the Android OS will certainly cost you far less than designing a laundry delivery app for iOS as designing an iOS app requires a far greater number and complexity of code owing to its complex architecture and working mechanism.</p>
                            <p>On an average, designing an iOS app takes at least 50 working hours more than the time taken to design an Android app. Therefore, the cost involved is also higher.</p>

                            <h3>The Coding Technology Employed</h3>
                            <p>Until about seven years ago, mobile app developers had to use different coding technologies to 
                            develop separate apps for Android and iOS platforms. This costed organizations a lot of money.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, from 2015 onwards, a handful of cross-platform mobile app development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, Flutter, etcetera were developed. These cross-platform mobile app development platforms use only a single coding technology to develop apps that can run on Android as well as iOS. Hence, they greatly reduce cost to develop a laundry delivery app for companies.</p>
                            <p>Even so, they all employ different coding technologies to develop cross-platform apps and will generate different app development costs for organisations.</p>

                            <h3>Number And Complexity Of Features Required</h3>
                            <p>A feature-rich laundry delivery app will take between 140 to 200 working hours to develop while a basic and viable laundry delivery app can be developed in 48 to 72 hours.</p>
                            <p>Also, if the laundry business owner demands an advanced and complex UI and app features, it will obviously cost him more. So, the number and complexity of app features heavily influences its development cost.</p>

                            <h3>Region In The World Where The App Is Being Developed</h3>
                            <p>Mobile app developers in different countries or regions of the world charge differently for their services. Given below is a list of their approximate hourly rates.</p>
                            <p><u><i>The USA:</i></u>&nbsp;Mobile app developers in the US are the most expensive. They charge between USD 50 to USD 250 per hour for mobile app development.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Australia:</i></u>&nbsp;App developers in Australia charge between USD 80 to USD 120 per hour for mobile app development. They are cheaper than the US but still quite costly.</p>
                            <p><u><i>Europe:</i></u>&nbsp;Mobile app developers in Europe charge between USD 30 to USD 150 per hour for mobile app development. They can be cheap or expensive to hire.</p>
                            <p><u><i>India:</i></u>&nbsp;Mobile app developers in India are the cheapest to hire. They can develop top-notch mobile applications for as low as USD 10 to USD 80 per hour.</p>
