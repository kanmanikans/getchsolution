                            <p>As you may already know, Android and iOS mobile OS platforms are the most widely used and
                                the only mobile OS platforms in the world. They have managed to subdue all their
                                competitors like Windows, Linux Ubuntu, G2 deals, etc. to rise to prominence. Currently,
                                the Android OS controls about 87% of the global mobile phone market share and iOS
                                controls about 13% of the global mobile phone market share.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the main dilemma that entrepreneurs face today is, “Should I <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/">develop an
                                    Android or iOS app for my business</a>?” That is a really good question as it
                                requires deep evaluation and judgment. Both mobile OS platforms have their pros and cons
                                and you must choose your business app type based on your current business requirements,
                                target audience, and budget (for the app development project).</p>


                            <h2 id="1">The Significant Benefits Of Ios Over Android Apps</h2>
                            <p>As mentioned before, both the Android and iOS mobile OS platforms have their advantages
                                and disadvantages but research has shown that developing iOS apps is slightly more
                                beneficial for businesses in any industry and we shall have a detailed study on the
                                reasons for that in the following section.</p>
                            <p>iOS apps give the following significant benefits to business owners, which Android apps
                                cannot give:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    iOS app users are mostly highly educated and well-settled working professionals
                                    living in developed countries like the US, Canada, Australia, etcetera. They
                                    love iOS apps of any kind and spend a lot of time on the apps (i.e., the user
                                    engagement is very high). iOS app users are hard to acquire but once acquired,
                                    they become loyal users of iOS apps, which is not the case for Android users.

                                    Iphone and ipad users spend an average of USD 140 in buying iOS apps every week.
                                    Android smartphone users on the other hand spend only about USD 6.19 on monthly
                                    native Android app purchases. So, Apple’s users give a lot of income and profits
                                    to businesses that have their own high quality iOS apps.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>The reason for this could be due to the fact that iOS app users earn at least 2 to 10
                                times more per month than average Android app users.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Iphones and ipads have a more or less standard size and shape. This makes it easy
                                    for iOS app developers to optimize the display of their respective iOS apps. An
                                    easier task implies a lesser time to develop the iOS app which leads to a lesser
                                    iOS app development cost
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>On the other hand, Android smartphones come in a wide variety of sizes and optimizing an
                                app’s display to suit the vast majority of Android smartphones in the market is very
                                difficult, which leads to much higher app development time and costs.</p>

                            <p>The bottomline is that even though Android apps have a much larger user base than iOS
                                apps and are comparable to iOS apps in their versatility and sophistication, iOS app
                                users give their respective business owners twenty to thirty times more monthly revenue
                                and profits when compared to Android app users.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to business, money matters a lot. Hence, <a

                            <p>So, as you can see, iOS apps are easier and faster to develop when compared to Android
                                apps. The review and approval process for iOS apps is also short and simple but best of
                                all, iOS apps give their respective business owners a ton of digital income and profits
                                while Android apps give far lower levels of digital income and profits to their
                                respective business owners. Hence, developing official iOS apps would be advisable for
                                businesses in any industry.</p>

                            <h2 id="3">A Comprehensive Guide To Estimate The Cost Of IOS App Development</h2>

                            <p>Unfortunately or fortunately, there is no binary answer to this question. The cost to
                                develop an iOS app depends on a multitude of factors. Some of the important ones are
                                listed below.</p>

                            <h3>The Complexity And The Number Of Desired Features</h3>
                            <p>This point is quite intuitional. Obviously, the more the number of app features you would
                                want, the more development time it’s going to take and the more it’s going to cost you
                                to develop the iOS app.</p>
                            <p>Even demanding elaborate and complex features for your iOS app is going to require a high
                                degree of technical expertise from the app development team and a lot of app development
                                time. Hence, it too will cost you more.</p>

                            <h3>The Experience And Expertise Of The App Development Team</h3>
                            <p>Enterprises are beginning to discover that contracting an app development team is way
                                more cost-effective and effective than hiring in-house, full time app developers.</p>
                            <p>The contracted app development team can be expanded or cut down to suit your dynamic
                                project requirements unlike hiring in-house, full time app developers. Also, once the
                                app development project is complete, the contacted team can be dismantled unlike in the
                                case of hiring in-house, full time app developers.</p>
                            <p>Even if you approach an app development agency for your interim app development project
                                needs, the hourly charges will certainly vary. Recently launched app development
                                agencies will mostly have freshers who will charge you low hourly app development
                                charges as there is stiff competition in the field and they are yet to prove themselves
                                sufficiently before demanding more.</p>
                            <p>More established app development agencies will mostly have tenured app developers who
                                would have completed several of their clients’ projects successfully. Hence, such app
                                development agencies will charge a lot more (two to three times more) for their services
                                than recently founded app development agencies. While established app development
                                agencies can certainly complete your app development project marvelously, their hourly
                                rates might breach your project’s budget.</p>
                            <p>While the hourly charges of newly established app development agencies will most likely
                                fall within your budget, quality of work is not a given. The inexperienced app
                                developers in such agencies may complete your app development project satisfactorily and
                                innovatively or they may also do it in a shoddy and sketchy manner.</p>
                            <p>Hence, you are best advised to approach a reasonably established app development agency
                                who have successfully completed a few client projects. Always, visit the app development
                                agency in person, interact with their team members, verify their app development
                                portfolio, and read their ex-clients’ testimonials to get a fair idea about their
                                knowledge, experience, dedication, and authenticity.</p>

                            <h3>The Time Taken For Testing The App</h3>
                            <p>Simple business application apps will have brief and easily testable features. Testing
                                simple business apps will require the least amount of time and effort from the app
                                testing team. Hence, if your official app has simple features and a simple layout,
                                getting it tested under all possible circumstances will cost you a considerably lesser
                                amount.</p>
                            <p>If your app has a complicated design and features, testing it will take a lot more time
                                and effort thus costing you a lot more money. The elaborate features of your
                                sophisticated official app also need to be organized properly for swift testing. If not
                                done already, the testing team will have to properly organize your app’s features before
                                testing your app and that will take a lot of testing time and money.</p>

                            <h3>The Cyber Security Of The Server Hosting Your App</h3>

                            <p>Your business app might host monetary transactions or may involve sharing of important
                                official information and files. Hence, information security becomes of paramount
                                importance.</p>
                            <p>You can buy one or more dedicated servers with multi-layer cyber security frameworks but
                                that will cost you quite a lot of money. You can also opt for shared web hosting and
                                common cyber security but then you’ll have no control over the level of cyber security
                                provided and your precious official information might be hacked leading to loss of
                                customers’ trust, customers, business volume, revenue, and profits.</p>
                            <p>So, it is always recommended to go for a higher level of server security despite it
                                costing more because customers or clients are the pillars of any business and the loss
                                of customers or clients will spell doomsday for your business.</p>

                            <h3>The Complexity Of Your UI/UX Design</h3>

                            <p>Apps with simple and easy-to-navigate UIs will cost a lot less to design. A UI with
                                advanced features and heavy graphical content will cost a lot more to design but will
                                surely have a higher user engagement. So, you must choose your UI’s layout and features
                                based on your app’s requirements and your project’s budget.</p>

                            <h2>After-Project App Maintenance</h2>

                            <p>If you need your app development agency to provide certain additional services like App
                                Store Optimization (ASO), run-time bug fixing and app maintenance, and other <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/digital-marketing/">digital marketing
                                    services</a> like Social Media Marketing (SMM), customer/client support, etcetera.
                                After the completion of your project, it’s obviously going to cost you more but will
                                give you numerous significant benefits and will make your app development project
                                worthwhile.</p>

                            <p>Generally speaking, the average cost of iOS app development varies widely between USD
                                30,000 to USD 300,000. So, that’s why there is no binary answer to the question whether
                                iOS app development is affordable or expensive.</p>
