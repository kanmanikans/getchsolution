                            <h2 id="1">What is tech stack in mobile app development?</h2>
                            <p>Technology stack refers to the various phases of a mobile app development project during
                                which different app functionalities are developed for various purposes. Technology stack
                                is classified into three broad categories which are listed below.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Frontend Mobile App Development</h3>
                            <p>The frontend app development phase involves building the app’s UI and other important
                                features that enable users to interact with the app. The app’s core functionalities are
                                usually built in this phase of app development.</p>

                            <h3 id="3">Backend Mobile App Development</h3>
                            <p>This app development phase involves building features on the app that can handle database
                                creation requirements and connection requests that arise when users interact with the
                                app. These are the functionalities of the app that users are not concerned about but
                                which are required for the smooth flow of business operations.</p>

                            <h3 id="4">Add Ons</h3>
                            <p>After meeting all of the app’s design and functionalities requirements, a round of
                                discussion is held with the client to verify the correctness of the project done and to
                                check if the client requires any additional app features and functionalities.</p>
                            <p>If additional app features and functionalities are required by the client, they are
                                incorporated into the app if possible. This practice is upheld to ensure 100% client
                                satisfaction and integrity of the app development project undertaken.</p>

                            <h2 id="5">The Most Widely Used Mobile Application Development Technologies</h2>
                            <p>The following are the most widely used coding technologies for mobile app development.
                                These technologies are used to create both native and cross-platform apps. The following
                                coding technologies are swift, secure, scalable, and feature-rich.

                            <h3 id="6">Kotlin</h3>
                            <p>Kotlin is a more concise and secure programming language than Java for building mobile
                                apps. It is used to build native Android apps. Kotlin was initially designed to provide
                                functional support for JVM but has now been upgraded so that it can be used in tandem
                                with Java for mobile app development.</p>
                            <p>Popular mobile apps like Coursera, Foursquare, Trello, Basecamp, Capital One, Coin Switch
                                Kuber, PubG, etcetera have been coded in Kotlin.</p>

                            <h3 id="7">Swift</h3>
                            <p>Swift is coding technology developed by Apple in 2014. It had replaced the Objective C
                                coding technology previously used by Apple’s devices such as iPhones, iPads, Apple
                                laptops and desktops, etcetera. The Swift programming language is used to <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/iphone-application/">develop
                                    native iOS apps</a>. Apps designed using Swift are
                                extremely fast and feature-rich.</p>
                            <p>Some popular apps designed using Swift are LinkedIn, Accenture, Lyft, CNN, Jumbo Race,
                                etcetera.</p>
                            <h3 id="8">Java</h3>
                            <p>Good old Java is used to develop native Android apps. Next to Python, it is one of the
                                world’s most advanced and versatile object oriented programming languages.</p>
                            <p>The language is capable of offering open source libraries, community support, and
                                outstanding documentation supporting developers when it comes to building different
                                Android applications. Java’s multithreading feature and vast libraries enable the
                                creation of advanced and graphics-heavy mobile applications.</p>
                            <p>Some popular apps designed using Java are Spotify, VLC Media Player, Telegram, Twitter,
                                Omni Notes, Counter Strike versions, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3 id="9">Python</h3>
                            <p>We bet many of you were expecting this option and rightfully so. Python is easily the
                                world’s most robust and versatile programming language with many applications. So,
                                obviously, hi-tech and cross-platform mobile apps can be developed using only a tiny
                                fraction of Python’s vast libraries and capabilities.</p>
                            <p>Python’s web application frameworks like Django, Flask, Cherry Py, and Web2Py can be used
                                to build swift, secure, scalable, interactive, and cross-platform mobile apps. Apps
                                built using Python are feature-rich yet have a user-friendly GUI which makes them easy
                                to use.</p>
                            <h3 id="10">Flutter</h3>
                            <p>Flutter is an open-source SDK (Software Development Kit) designed by the Silicon Valley
                                tech behemoth, Google. Flutter uses the Dart programming language to develop swift and
                                secure cross-platform apps.</p>
                            <p>Popular apps developed using the Dart coding technology include: Alibaba, Google Ads,
                                Hamilton Musical, Reflectively, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3 id="11">React Native</h3>
                            <p>React Native is an open-source SDK developed by Meta (formerly known as Facebook) and
                                Microsoft on 26/03/2015. It was developed after a ground-breaking discovery was made by
                                Facebook’s engineer, Jordan Walke.</p>
                            <p>Jordan Walke discovered that apps that were coded in Javascript retained about 90% of
                                their original source code when being redesigned for iOS. It was since this discovery
                                that cross-platform SDKs and apps began gaining popularity and demand.</p>
                            <p>Some popular apps designed using React Native are: Myntra, Facebook/Meta, Airbnb, Zomato,
                                EaseMyTrip, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3 id="12">Xamarin</h3>
                            <p>Xamarin is an open-source SDK acquired by Microsoft in 2016. It employs the C# coding
                                technology and the .net framework to design cross-platform mobile apps.</p>
                            <p>Though Xamarin cannot support apps that require multi-touch functionalities, it can be
                                used to build top-notch gaming apps and other apps that require only a single-touch
                                functionality.</p>
                            <p>Some popular apps built using Xamarin include Oyo, Story Creator, MRF, Captio, CA Mobile,
                                Pinterest, Skype, The World Bank, Fresh Direct, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3 id="13">R</h3>
                            <p>You read it right. R is a recently developed programming language used to build
                                cross-platform analytics-oriented apps. It has vast and robust math and graphics
                                libraries that can be used to build analytical, graphics-oriented, and CAD-based apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mobile applications that make extensive use of the Machine Learning technology are best
                                designed using the R coding technology. Since this is a very recent coding technology
                                (launched only a few months back), not many apps have been coded via it and have become
                                popular.</p>
                            <h2 id="14">What Are The Factors To Be Considered For Choosing The Right Technology Stack
                                For Mobile
                                App Development</h2>
                            <p>The Latest Mobile App Development Technologies Now that you have come across all the
                                popularly used mobile app development SDKs and
                                coding technologies, you might be wondering which one to choose and how to choose the
                                apt coding technology and SDK (if applicable) for your mobile app.</p>
                            <p>Don’t worry. We’ll help you make the right decision. These are the factors to consider
                                before deciding on any app development coding technology and SDK.</p>
                            <h3 id="15">The Demographics Of Your Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>Android apps are more popular in certain nations of the world while iOS apps are more
                                popular in others. Depending on the nation in which your company is based, you must
                                decide upon developing an official app for Android or iOS platform.</p>
                            <p>Android apps are generally widely used in developing nations like India, China, Malaysia,
                                Cuba, Brazil, etcetera. Android apps are also used extensively by lower middle class and
                                middle class people.</p>
                            <p>iOS apps are generally widely used in developed nations like the USA, Canada, Japan,
                                Singapore, Australia, etcetera by tech savvy people. iOS app users also spend five to
                                ten times more than Android app users on in-app purchases. So, if you’re trying to make
                                people buy something via your app then developing an iOS app would be a wise choice.</p>
                            <h3 id="16">The Age Of Your Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>If your app is mostly meant for people above the age of 30 then you’re better off
                                developing an Android app because most of the Android users presently are aged above 30.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the contrary, if you want to develop a hi-tech gaming or other purpose app meant for
                                teenagers and people in their mid 20s, then you’re better off developing a native iOS
                                app as iOS users are big fans of hi-tech mobile apps and are mostly aged between 13 and
                                29.</p>
                            <h3 id="17">The Demands Of Your Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>If your target audience is the common man who meets his daily needs via various on-demand
                                delivery apps, then you’re better off designing an Android app via concise coding
                                technologies like Kotlin or Python.</p>
                            <p>If your target audience are highly educated people, tech savvy people, aristocrats,
                                businesses, or entrepreneurs who demand advanced apps like business analytics apps,
                                graphics-heavy gaming apps, apps that extensively use AI, Machine Learning, and CAD
                                technologies then you’re better off designing a native iOS app to meet such demands.</p>
                            <h3 id="18">The Budget And Timeline Constraints Of Your Project</h3>
                            <p>If you have a relatively low budget for your app development project and if it needs to
                                be completed relatively quickly (within a few months) then you’d be well advised to
                                develop a native iOS app as iOS apps can be developed 30 – 40% quicker than Android apps
                                and cost about 20 – 30% less to develop.</p>
                            <h3 id="19">Determine If You Want To Reach Out To And Satisfy All</h3>
                            <p>If your goal is to develop an app that can be used by all for some of the most common
                                purposes then you can consider developing a cross-platform app using any one of the
                                popular SDKs like React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, R, or Python.</p>
                            <p>Cross-platform apps can definitely satisfy the requirements of all users and can be run
                                on any mobile OS platform but their performance has been observed to be a shade lower
                                than native apps. So, kindly keep this in mind before opting to develop cross-platform
                                apps.</p>
                            <h3 id="20">Your App Must Adhere To The Respective App Store Guidelines</h3>
                            <p>Apart from being fully featured yet easy-to-navigate (via a robust yet simple to use
                                GUI), your app must adhere to the App Store’s guidelines it was designed for. Android’s
                                app store is called Play Store and iOS’s app store is called The App Store.</p>
                            <p>Cross-platform apps must satisfy the guidelines of both the app stores before they can be
                                launched into the app market. The guidelines basically deal with the ease of use and
                                performance of your app.</p>
                            <p>If your app is easy to navigate, feature rich, fast, and has no objectionable or
                                controversial content then it’ll get approved by the app stores quickly and be launched
                                into the app market quickly lest your app will get rejected by one or both the app
                                stores.</p>
                            <h3 id="21">Need A Hi-Tech Official App? Leave It To The Experts</h3>
