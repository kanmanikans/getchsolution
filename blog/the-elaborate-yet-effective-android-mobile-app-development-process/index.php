                            <p>Android smartphones and Android apps have the largest user base in the world of around
                                83% of the mobile phone and app market. This is because they are cheaper yet as
                                efficient as iphones and iOS apps.
                                Hence, most of the mobile app developers prefer to develop native Andoid apps instead of
                                native iOS apps but what exactly is the process involved in developing an Android app?
                                That’s what we’ll have a look at in this blog post so, kindly stay tuned.</p>

                            <p style="font-weight: 400;">Doing proper market research involves the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <p>Identifying your target audience and their requirements that your app can satisfy.
                                </p>
                                <p>Understanding your target audience’s requirements and expectations from the app so
                                    that you can design your app accordingly. </p>
                                <p>Checking whether your app can have any additional functionalities that will give you
                                    an edge over your competitors. </p>
                                <p>Analyzing and understanding what app development processes your competitors follow
                                    and what their users like about their apps
                                    so that you can incorporate those features in your app or better still, install even
                                    better features on your app.</p>
                                <p>Deciding on the coding technology or SDK you’re going to use for app development.
                                    There are a ton of coding technologies and
                                    SDKs out there to develop native and hybrid apps and you need to choose one that
                                    most aligns with your target audience’s preferences and requirements. </p>
                                <p>If you’re app is going to be a paid app, you need to check your competitor’s pricings
                                    and price your app competitively. It should be worth its features
                                    but not priced so much that your customers feel that it’s costly.</p>
                                <p>You must choose your app’s features in such a way that your customers’ requirements
                                    and the essential functionalities are covered but you must not incorporate
                                    too many features into your app such that it takes way too long to develop and
                                    deploy. </p>
                            </ul><br>
                            <p>Prolonged app development time will only increase your app development cost and heighten
                                the chances of you facing more competition in the chosen niche.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Planning And Creating A Wireframe For The Design Of The App</h3>
                            <p>Once you have done the market research and got to know about your target audience’s app
                                requirements and expectations,
                                you can build a wireframe for the app and start refining it until the optimal design is
                                arrived at.</p>
                            <p>Your app’s UI must be attractive, engaging, sophisticated, yet easy to navigate to
                                acquire and retain the maximum possible users.</p>
                            <p>A wireframe of an app is like the roadmap to its design. It defines what the app must
                                look like and what features and functionalities it must have. The better the wireframe
                                of an app is designed, the better the app will look and perform and the better user
                                ratings and reviews it’ll get.</p>

                            <h3 id="3">Designing The Android App</h3>
                            <p>The Android app has to be designed according to the wireframe that has been developed and
                                finalized. The app has to meet (or even surpass) the requirements and expectations of
                                your target audience. </p>
                            <p>To design an Android app, one needs to refine and finalize its wireframe, choose the
                                appropriate coding technology and SDK depending on the preferences of the target
                                audience,
                                and design the frontend, UI, and backend sections of the app using appropriate coding
                                technologies like Javascript, Node.js, Fiver, etcetera. All of the app’s the design and
                                performance objectives must be met.</p>

                            <h3 id="4">Testing The Android App</h3>
                            <p>Testing your Android app thoroughly and under all possible use case scenarios is
                                important as it will preserve the
                                functional integrity of your app and enable your users to have a seamless and smooth
                                experience. </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: 400;">Testing an Android app has three phases. They are as listed
                                below.</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <p>The UI/UX or the frontend section of the app, has to be thoroughly tested to ensure
                                    that your users get a great experience while browsing the app.
                                    A smooth and seamless UI/UX will heighten user engagement and retention. </p>
                                <p>The performance of every feature of the app must be tested thoroughly to detect and
                                    correct any flaws present in the app’s design and functionality. This
                                    practice will ensure that the functional integrity of the app is maintained and
                                    thereby the reputation of the company. </p>
                                <p>The data security standards of the app has to be deeply scrutinized so that any chink
                                    in data security can be identified and corrected.
                                    Securing and keeping private customers’ data is very essential to any business. If
                                    the security and privacy of an app is compromised, it will see a sharp decline in
                                    the number of its users as it happened with Facebook a few years ago.</p>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="5">App Store Optimization (ASO)</h3>
                            <p>Once designing your Android app has been completed, you must apply appropriate App Store
                                Optimization (ASO) techniques
                                to rank your app on Play Store. Your Android app has to be optimized for:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <p><b><i>Its title:</i></b> The title of your Android app has to be short, catchy, and
                                    relevant to your niche to attract the attention of your target audience.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Its description: </i></b>The description of your app has to be appealing and
                                    compelling. It has to describe concisely what your app does and what are the
                                    advantages of using it.
                                    The more compelling your app’s description is, the more downloads it’ll get and the
                                    more money it’ll make for you.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Its category: </i></b>It’s common sense that your app needs to be categorized
                                    correctly to be visible to your target audience.
                                    Otherwise, it’ll show up on irrelevant searches and will hardly get any downloads.
                                </p>
                                <p><b><i>Its keywords:</i></b>Relevant keywords with high search volumes but relatively
                                    low competition have to be used to optimize your app for Play Store.
                                    Only then your app will be listed high on relevant Play Store searches and will get
                                    more downloads.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Its icon:</i></b>The icon or logo of your app has to be consistent (relevant)
                                    and eye-catching. It must convey the services and values your business stands for.
                                    An attractive and consistent icon will make a good impression on users and augment
                                    app downloads.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Its use case screenshots: </i></b>The Android app’s use case screenshots
                                    uploaded on Play Store must convince your target audience that your app is useful
                                    and convenient to use.
                                    It must impress upon your target audience, the advantages of using your app.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 id="6">Periodically updating your app</h3>
                            <p>Just ranking your Android app on Play Store is not the end of the road or enough. You
                                must actively listen to your users’ reviews and implement any meaningful suggestions
                                they might have.
                                Only then you can maintain your customer satisfaction and an edge over your competitors.
                            </p>
