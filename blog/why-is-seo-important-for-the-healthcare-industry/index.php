                            <h2 id="1">Why We Are Considered The Best SEO Company For Financial Services</h2>

                            <p>Most people are acquainted with only one type of financial institution which is a bank
                                that provides various kinds of loans among other services to people but you might be
                                surprised to know that there are other kinds of financial institutions apart from banks
                                which are described below.</p>

                            <h3>Commercial Banks</h3>
                            <p>Commercial banks can be publicly or privately owned. They deal directly with customers.
                                They provide various kinds of loans to people like vehicle loans, housing loans, gold
                                loans, educational loans, personal loans, etcetera. </p>
                            <p>The interest they charge their customers depends on the type of loan taken. Generally
                                speaking, personal loans have the highest rate of interest upto 20%. In India, the
                                interest rates charged by banks is directly propotional to the repo rate charged by
                                India’s central bank, the RBI.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Central Banks</h3>
                            <p>A central bank is the chief financial institute of any country. It is always founded,
                                owned, and run by the central government. It is responsible for providing lonas to all
                                the other financial institutions in a nation. </p>
                            <p>India’s central bank is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It provides loans to other banks
                                in India at an interest rate called the “Repo Rate” which is determined autonomously by
                                the bank. People cannot directly get in touch with central banks. They transact via
                                commercial banks which have dealings with central banks.</p>



                            <h3 id="3">Internet Banks</h3>
                            <p>This is a relatively new concept ushered by the advancement of internet technology over
                                the past decade. Internet banks can be classified into two types which are digital banks
                                and neo banks.
                            </p>
                            <p>Digital banks are basically apps of existing public and private sector banks. Such
                                commercial banks now offer their financial services even via their dedicated apps. Neo
                                banks are banks that only have an online presence or dedicated apps for themselves. They
                                offer their financial services only via their respective apps and do not have brick and
                                mortar branches anywhere. </p>

                            <h3 id="4">Credit Unions</h3>
                            <P>Credit unions are usually founded, owned, and run by a community of people living in a
                                certain geographic location like a village, town, city, state, or a nation.
                                Traditionally, such unions only used to offer loans to their specific community people
                                such as teachers, doctors, labor unions, truck association, etcetera. </P>
                            <P>Their interest rates are also significantly lower than commercial banks. Now, these
                                credit unions have opened themselves up to the general public and anyone can avail loans
                                from these credit unions</P>


                            <h3 id="5">Savings And Loan Associations</h3>
                            <p>This type of financial institution is partially owned by its customers. A few customers
                                will have stakes in any savings and loan associations. These type od financial
                                institutions enable people to open savings account, apply for various types of loans,
                                and enable then to mortgage their homes and other properties. </p>
                            <p>Generally, savings and loan associations are privately owned. Savings and loan
                                associations lend people money at rates that are significantly lower than commercial
                                banks.</p>



                            <h3 id="6">Investment Banks</h3>
                            <p>Investment banks were formerly known as mutual fund organizations. Such financial
                                institutions do not provide loans to people directly or accept their deposits but rather
                                help people and organizations secure loans and investments by issuing securities to
                                them. </p>
                            <p>Investment banks have various mutual fund investment schemes via which people invest
                                money in these institutions and get positive ROIs after a span of a few months or a few
                                years. </p>
                            <p>Investment banks also play the role of a mediator when public or private firms in any
                                industry undertake complex and elaborate financial processes such as going for an IPO,
                                issuing pensions, settlement of foreign debt, etcetera.</p>

                            <h2 id="7">Brokerage Banks</h2>
                            <p>Brokerage banks act as a mediator between customers and investment banks. They help
                                people buy and sell securities, stocks, bonds, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). </p>


                            <h3 id="8">Insurance Firms</h3>
                            <p>Companies that protect people against financial loss due to loss of life, damage to
                                property, disability, and other misfortunes are known as insurance firms.</p>
                            <p>To undertake any kind of insurance like car insurance, house insurance, any appliance
                                insurance, etcetera, people need to choose from the insurance plans available and pay
                                monthly premiums until their insurance policy matures.</p>



                            <h3 id="9">Mortgage Firms</h3>
                            <p>These financial firms lend loans to people if they mortgage any one of their equivalent
                                properties. Such firms’ money is funded by other specialized financial institutes.
                                Mortgage firms’ interest rates are about half that of commercial banks. Hence, they are
                                an attractive source of loans for people.</p>

                            <p>The success of your lead conversion campaigns doesn’t just depend on a single factor but
                                a multitude of factors. Only if all the elements of success are applied properly, your
                                lead conversion rate will spike. The major elements of lead conversion success are as
                                listed below.</p>

                            <p>Have a simple financial service subscription process: Your financial institution’s
                                official website must be as simple to understand and easy to navigate as possible lest
                                your leads and other users will get frustrated and leave your website and quite possibly
                                even your financial institution. </p>
                            <p>Subscribing for any of your financial services should be made as simple and as short as
                                possible on your official website to give your users and leads a pleasurable website
                                browsing experience and increase the chances of your leads subscribing for your
                                financial services. If certain financial services require the physical signatures of
                                your leads then you must ensure that adequate sales representatives are available in all
                                of your service localities. </p>
                            <p>Your official website must be available in all applicable regional languages: Everybody
                                on earth loves their mother tongue more than any other language in existence. Therefore,
                                it would be preferable if your official website is available in all the regional
                                languages of your service localities so that you may tap the emotional quotient of your
                                leads and users which will most likely result in enhanced lead conversion rate. </p>
                            <p>Contact your leads at a time when they’ll most likely be free: Your leads will most
                                likely be free post 7 PM on weekdays and during morning and evening times on weekends.
                                Reaching out to your leads during these times will make you most likely get a response
                                from them and thereby heighten your lead conversion rate. Time sense is necessary not
                                just for people but for organizations as well. </p>
                            <p>Have experienced sales representatives reach out to your leads: Reaching out to your
                                leads is a very important job indeed. The business prospects and the growth of your
                                financial institution depends on the quality of work done. </p>
                            <p>To derive the maximum possible benefits for your financial institution, it would be
                                advisable to delegate skilled and seasoned sales representatives to reach out to your
                                leads. This is not to say that freshers in the financial services sales domain are not
                                skilled or trustworthy.</p>
