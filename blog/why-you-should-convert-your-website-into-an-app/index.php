                                mobile apps these days. This is because mobile phones are light-weight and portable and
                                mobile apps can be used anywhere and anytime. Since millennials and netizens constitute
                                the vast majority of the customer base of any company, every organization today feels

                                and what are the factors to consider before converting your official website into your
                                official app? That’s exactly what we’re going to discuss in this article. So, stay
                                tuned. </p>
                            <h2>Top 3 Factors To Consider Before You Convert Your Website Into A User-Friendly Mobile
                                App</h2>
                            <p>These are the important factors you should consider before you convert your website into
                                a user-friendly mobile app to derive the maximum possible benefit from your official app
                                and to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
                            <h3 id="1">Analyze The Performance And UX Of Your Website</h3>
                            <p>You must analyze and understand your official website’s performance and experience from
                                your users’ perspective thoroughly. Only then you’ll get to know what your users like
                                about your official website and what they don’t.</p>
                            <p>Then when you design your official app, you can correct all the flaws that your website
                                had so that your official app is 100% optimized and gives a smooth and seamless user
                                experience. Well-designed apps get way more downloads, ratings, and positive reviews
                                than “run-of-the-mill” apps.</p>
                            <h3 id="2">Analyse And Understand The Behavior Of Your Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>You must analyze and understand the mentality, expectations, and behavior of your target
                                audience or users. Users from different regions of the world predominantly use Android,
                                iOS, or hybrid apps.</p>
                            <p>Highly educated, high income, and tech savvy people living in developed nations like the
                                USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, Singapore, etcetera predominantly use iPhones and iOS
                                apps. They like and use native iOS apps that are fully featured and fast.</p>
                            <p>Such tech savvy users spend two to five times more on in-app purchases than native
                                Android users. So, if your company is headquartered in a developed country and your
                                customers are mostly tech savvy people, you’ll be better off designing a native iOS app.
                            </p>
                            <p>Native Android apps and Android smartphones are predominantly used by middle-income
                                (working class) people in developing nations like India, China, Malaysia, Brazil,
                                etcetera.</p>
                            <p>Such users are okay with decently featured apps with a slower speed when compared to
                                native iOS apps. They spend only about 5 to 20% on in-app purchases when compared to
                                native iOS app users. These users prefer native Android apps that are free to download
                                and have little to no in-app purchases.</p>
                            <p>So, if your company is headquartered in a developing country and if your customers are
                                predominantly Android smartphone users then you’ll be better off developing a native
                                Android app for your business.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, you must also understand what your customers’ expectations are from
                                apps pertaining to your industry and design your official app accordingly. You may
                                either send your customers survey questions via SMSs and emails or you may use the data
                                from previously conducted app usage analysis.</p>
                            <h3 id="3">Ensure That Your App’s Layout Is Optimized For All Smart Devices</h3>
                            <p>Android smartphones, iphones, and ipads vary greatly in their size and design. You must
                                design your official app’s layout in such a way that the layout suits at least most of
                                the target smart devices (iphones and ipads in case of native iOS apps and Android
                                smartphones in case of native Android apps.</p>
                            <p>Only if the UI and UX of your official app is aptly designed, it will create a great user
                                experience and help you in retaining your existing customer base.</p>
                            <h2>4 Ways To Convert Your Website Into An App</h2>
                            <p>As mobile apps provide greater conveniences than websites, ever more millennials,
                                netizens, and the common folklore are beginning to use mobile apps for a lot of
                                different purposes and thereby businesses are finding it imperative to convert their
                                official website into a user-friendly mobile app to retain their customer base and to
                                keep up with the current trends.</p>
                            <p>So, how exactly can you convert your official website into a fully-featured and
                                user-friendly mobile app? Well, there are 4 main ways to achieve this which are listed
                                below.</p>
                            <h3 id="4">Code Your Official App Yourself</h3>
                            <p>This should be done only if you feel that you have researched and understood your
                                customers’ app expectations very well and if you are at least reasonably good at coding.
                            </p>
                            <p>If there are any shortcomings on your official website and/or if your customers would
                                like some additional features on your official app, you must keep them in mind while
                                designing your official app.</p>
                            <p>Your official app must address the shortcomings of your website and it must also have the
                                additional features (if applicable) and performance that your customers’ desire for it
                                to be a hit with your customers and on the app market.</p>
                            <p>After analyzing and understanding all the factors mentioned in the previous topic, you
                                can choose to build a native Android or <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/iphone-application/">iOS
                                    app</a> app or a hybrid app if you don’t want to compromise on your user base.</p>
                            <h3 id="5">Hire A Freelance App Developer</h3>
                            <p>Hiring a freelance app developer is certainly a far cheaper option than signing a
                                contract with an app development agency but there are certain limitations to this
                                approach and certain precautions you need to take before going for this option.</p>
                            <p>You must first verify if the freelance app developer that you are hiring has prior
                                experience in developing hi-tech mobile apps. Freshers in this field are definitely
                                highly cost-effective to hire but you may not get the desired result.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, its advisable to hire a freelance app developer with proven experience to get
                                your desired results and to preserve the reputation of your company.</p>
                            <p>A poor quality mobile app will surely ruin the reputation of your organization and may
                                even result in the loss of your existing customers which in turn will lead to loss of
                                revenue and profits for your organization which in turn may lead to the closure of your
                                business. So, care must be taken in this regard.</p>
                            <p>Freelance app developers may also not be able to provide other essential services for
                                your app like App Store Optimization (ASO) and Social Media Marketing (SMM). So, kindly
                                see if you’re okay with it before you hire a freelance app developer.</p>
                            <h3 id="6">Sign A Contract With A Renowned App Development Agency</h3>
                            <p>This approach is adopted by organizations who feel they are not specialists in mobile app
                                development and want their official app to be of the highest quality. Such organizations
                                will be willing to spend more for their outsourced app development project to get the
                                ideal official app that can safeguard their reputation and customer base.</p>
                            <p>Organizations must ensure that the app development agency they are planning to sign a
                                contract with has proven experience in the app development domain, an impressive app
                                development portfolio, and a lot of positive client reviews to get the best results for
                                their outsourced app development project.</p>
                            <p>The main advantages of this approach are that good results are almost certain and the app
                                development agency can offer other essential services for your official app such as App
                                Store Optimization (ASO) and Social Media Marketing (SMM) that will rank your app on
                                searches on app stores, will make your app known to your target audience, and will
                                heighten the app downloads that you get.</p>
                            <h3 id="7">Use A DIY App Builder To Build Your Official App</h3>
                            <p>A DIY (Do It Yourself) app builder is a GUI-based SDK that can be used to build a basic
                                app at minimal costs. If you’re okay with basic app features and functionalities, if
                                your budget to develop your official app is low, and if you don’t know coding and your
                                organization does not have software engineers, you can go for this option.</p>
                            <p>DIY app builders enable you to build a basic official app by dragging and dropping
                                various app-building options. They extract the information from your official website
                                via an inbuilt API and display it on your app. Examples of popular DIY app builders
                                include Appy Pie, GoodBarber, MobiLoud, etcetera</p>

                            <h3 id="9">Benefits of converting website to app</h3>
                            <p>One of the most important reasons that businesses should convert their business website
                                into an app is that the mobile application gives their clients with the option of
                                offline access. The ability to work offline is also the primary distinction between a
                                mobile app and a website.A mobile website can be accessed quickly from the browser of
                                any phone running any operating system. Apps, on the other hand, need the user to first
                                download and install the app from a marketplace before they can begin buying or viewing
                                content. This is the major barrier and stark distinction between a mobile website and a
                                mobile app.</p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>In conclusion, Convert Your Website Into An App is a strategic move that can offer
                                numerous benefits to both your business and your audience. As the digital landscape
                                continues to evolve, the demand for mobile-friendly experiences is at an all-time high.
                                By embracing this transformation, you can enhance user engagement, accessibility, and
                                brand visibility, ultimately driving growth and success</p>
                            <p>Mobile apps provide a more seamless and personalized experience for users, with features
                                such as push notifications, offline access, and enhanced interactivity. They also tap
                                into the vast ecosystem of app stores, making it easier for potential users to discover
                                and download your app.</p>
