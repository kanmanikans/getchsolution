                            <p>Owing to the global reach and clout of the internet, almost every organization in every
                                industry already has or is in a race to build its own official website. A website is
                                like an ID card of a company that it showcases to the world. Millennials and netizens
                                these days (and other people as well) judge the quality of a company by having a look at
                                its official website. The more well-designed and easy to navigate the official website
                                of a company is, the better the impression it’ll make on its target audience. According
                                to a recent survey conducted in the US, 57% of the people said that they would never
                                recommend a company to other people that has a poorly designed website. Another study
                                showed that if a company’s official website is poorly designed, hard to understand and
                                navigate, or takes too long to load; 60% of that company’s customers ditch that company
                                and shift to its competitors. In this article, we’ll elaborately discuss the importance
                                and benefits of an official website for an organization. So, kindly read on to know
                                more.</p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>The importance of an official website for an organization can never be overstated. They
                                are described below.

                            </p>

                            <h2 id="1">Gives Organizations Some Additional Online Revenue
                            </h2>
                            <p>If appropriate SEO techniques are applied to an organization’s official website, it will
                                rank on the first page of Google’s search results, get high amounts of web traffic and
                                user engagement every day, and qualify for Google’s AdSense program via which the
                                organization can get some additional online income.

                            </p>

                            <p>The investment required to apply appropriate SEO techniques to a website and make it rank
                                on Google is paltry compared to the digital income companies make via ads on their
                                websites.

                            </p>
