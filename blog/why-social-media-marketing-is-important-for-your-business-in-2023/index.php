                                people owing to the numerous benefits and conveniences they offer. Advertising and
                                hosting various engaging activities on various social media platforms have now become
                                the latest trends of companies rather than undertaking traditional means of advertising.
                                This is because Social Media Marketing (SMM) is far more accurate, far reaching,
                                cost-effective, swift, and impactful than traditional means of advertising. SMM is a

                                it in all aspects. SMM campaigns can be undertaken free of cost or for nominal costs.
                                They have been proven to have an average lead conversion rate of 15 to 20%, which is
                                very impressive. Does SMM provide any other benefits to a business? Kindly read on to
                                find out. </p>

                            <p>As mentioned earlier, Social Media Marketing (SMM) can be used to improve a brand in all
                                aspects and not merely advertise its products or services. Some of the significant ways
                                in which SMM helps build a brand are listed below</p>

                            <h3 id="1"> Enhances Your Brand’s Popularity And Trust</h3>
                            <p>Finding one’s target audience via appropriate social media platforms and groups, setting
                                up vibrant business pages on various social media platforms, and <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/digital-marketing/ppc-company/">advertising
                                    one’s products</a> or services to one’s target audience via appropriate social media
                                platforms and groups has now become a breeze for organizations.</p>
                            <p>They can also tie up with influencers in their industries to effortlessly sky-rocket
                                their brand awareness and lead conversion rates. Social media platforms and groups can
                                also be used to create various interesting activities to engage one’s target audience
                                with one’s brand. Via live chats and posts, one can also address any product or
                                service-related issues or suggestions one’s customers might have. </p>
                            <p>Thus social media platforms can be used to improve a brand in all aspects. This level of
                                personalized engagement with your customers and target audience to build your brand’s
                                popularity and trust is not possible via traditional means of advertising. </p>
                            <h3 id="2">You Can Grow Your Customer Base Exponentially</h3>
                            <p>As of today, a whopping 4.6 billion people worldwide have accounts on various social
                                media platforms. This gives a huge opportunity for businesses to exponentially grow
                                their customer base. </p>
                            <p>You can easily identify your target audience by searching for and joining appropriate
                                groups on various social media platforms. You can then send personalized marketing
                                messages to your target audience via live chats, personal posts, or emails to heighten
                                your lead conversion rate.</p>
                            <p>SMM methods have an impressive lead conversion rate of 15 to 20%. Multiply that by the
                                size of your target audience on various social media platforms and you’ll begin to see
                                and understand the enormity of the business growth opportunities you have. Social media
                                platforms can also be used to frequently engage with your existing customers and make
                                them your brand’s evangelists.</p>
                            <h3 id="3">You Can Get The Pulse Of Your Market And Your Rivals</h3>
                            <p>By having a stable and vibrant presence on various social media platforms, you can get to
                                know about the expectations and grievances of your customers and target audience. You
                                can also visit the business pages of your competitors and get to know about their latest
                                offers and business strategies and use that information to devise new and effective
                                business strategies for your business. </p>
                            <p>Social media platforms enale you to define a strong “personality” for your brand. Not all
                                the content you post on your business pages or elsewhere need to be promotional content.
                                You can create interesting and engaging activities like polls, quizzes, educational
                                games, posts on your latest offers, loyalty program, and schemes, your latest social
                                initiatives, your latest animal welfare initiatives, etcetera to impress and engage your
                                target audience, which will give you manifold benefits in the long run. </p>

                            <h3 id="4">You Can Gain Valuable Business Insights</h3>
                            <p>You can add the links to your social media business pages on various website analytics
                                platforms like Google Analytics. By doing so, you can gain a fair understanding of your
                                target audience and customers. </p>
                            <p>For example, you can get to know from which region of the world you get the bulk of your
                                business page visitors, are they mostly men or women, what is their age group, what are
                                their tastes, preferences, and expectations from your brand, how many views and
                                engagement each of your social media posts got, you can get a fair idea of your
                                customers’ buying trends and average monthly spending, etc. </p>
                            <p>Using all this valuable analytical data, you can devise methods to better your service or
                                you can launch new products or make upgrades to existing ones to meet your customers’
                                and target audience’s expectations regarding the quality of your products or service.
                            </p>
                            <p>You must ensure that the products your customers periodically order are available at
                                every one of your outlets at the time/seasons they usually order. This practice will
                                prevent disappointment for your customers and heighten your customer satisfaction and
                                retention</p>

                            <h3 id="5">Enhances Your Website Traffic And Google Rankings</h3>
                            <p>For many people and businesses, social media platforms are an <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/why-social-media-marketingsmm-is-important-for-your-business/">important
                                    source of online traffic</a> for their official websites during the initial days
                                since their launch. If your official website gets a large amount of relevant online
                                traffic from high profile social media sources, then it’ll make your website rank higher
                                on Google’s Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). </p>
                            <p>Sending personalized promotional messages via social media platforms or emails are
                                effective ways to heighten your lead conversion rate, business volume, and profit. </p>

                            <h3 id="6">You Can Convey Your Brand’s Origin, Business Values And Goals</h3>
                            <p>As stated before, social media platforms are a great way to personally interact with your
                                customers and target audience. In your social media business pages, you can talk about
                                the reason and motive behind founding your brand. </p>
                            <p>You can talk about the business challenges and opportunities your business had faced
                                during the initial days of its launch and thus far. You can also state how the hard work
                                of your team has brought your brand to the level it is in today. Last but not least, you
                                can talk about the social welfare initiatives (if any) your company has undertaken so
                                far and your future business plans and strategies. </p>
                            <p>Chances are that a few of your customers and target audience can relate to your brand’s
                                story and will share their own thus enhancing the interaction and engagement with your
                                brand. Even those people who can’t entirely relate to your brand’s story and struggle
                                will appreciate its business values and social initiatives thus augmenting your brand’s
                                reputation and popularity.</p>
