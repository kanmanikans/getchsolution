                                <p>Hence, people have turned towards smart mobile apps to carry out their daily chores.
                                    Food delivery apps are one type of smart apps that serve people’s daily
                                    requirements. Hence, there is a huge demand for food delivery services via high-end
                                    food delivery apps in India and around the world.</p>
                                <p>So, if you’re an aspiring entrepreneur, this is a great time to try your hands at the
                                    food delivery business and mint money in the industry. Developing a basic food
                                    delivery app will give you only a small success or a marginally positive ROI.
                                    However, developing an advanced and fully-featured food delivery app will help you
                                    beat your competitors and give you a very high ROI.</p>
                                <p>So, how exactly do we identify high-end food delivery apps from the rest of the lot?
                                    The best-in-class food delivery apps will have at least three variants of the app
                                    and a plethora of convenient features that benefit customers as well as online food
                                    delivery business owners. We shall discuss them in detail in the coming section.</p>

                                <h2 id="1">Modern Day Food Delivery Application Features</h2>
                                <p>Modern Day Food Delivery Application will have at least three variants of them and

                                    as well as online food delivery business owners.</p>

                                <h3>Customer App</h3>

                                <p><i><u>Registration on the app:</u></i>&nbsp;Customers can register themselves on any

                                    mobile numbers, or email ids. Logging into the food ordering app is done usually via
                                    OTPs to minimize the threat of users’ accounts being hacked.</p>

                                <p>Food delivery apps which provide for a dedicated account password should also
                                    incorporate the “Forgot password” option to enable users to reset their respective
                                    passwords in case they would have forgotten it.</p>

                                <h3>Features Of Food Delivery Applications In Restaurant</h3>
                                <p><i><u>Showing restaurants nearby:</u></i>&nbsp;Once the user has logged into the food
                                    ordering app, the app will display some of the restaurants in the user’s vicinity.
                                    The suggested restaurants displayed could be based on the user’s past orders or
                                    preferences.</p>

                                <p>In case the user decides to try a new restaurant or cuisine, he or she can search for
                                    restaurants or cuisines according to their respective categories on the food
                                    delivery app. If the user finds even that to be difficult, he or she can simply type
                                    the name of the Food Delivery Applications In Restaurant and relevant results will
                                    be displayed.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Estimated cost display and order placement:</u></i>&nbsp;Once the customer
                                    decides upon his or her restaurant to order from, he or she can then browse the
                                    restaurant’s menu and start adding food items to the cart.</p>

                                <p>Every time a new food item is added to the cart, the estimated total cost of the
                                    order is updated on a real-time basis on top of the cart icon. Features of Food
                                    Delivery Applications ensures that customers spend only what they are prepared to
                                    spend on their food order. Once customers have added all the food items they want to
                                    the cart, they can go ahead and place their orders.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Order scheduling:</u></i>&nbsp;Most of the time, customers would want their
                                    orders to be delivered as soon as possible but sometimes, customers may want their
                                    orders delivered at a later time in the day. In such a scenario, the order
                                    scheduling feature comes in handy.</p>

                                <p>For example: if today is your dear wife’s birthday and you have the cake cutting
                                    ceremony at 8:00 PM. There’s no guarantee that the desired cake type will be
                                    available if you choose to order it at 7:00 PM. If the desired cake item becomes
                                    unavailable at the time you choose to order, it could ruin the day for your wife and
                                    for you as well.</p>

                                <p>Instead, if the cake item is available in the morning, before you get ready to go to
                                    your office, you can order the cake item then and schedule its delivery between 7
                                    and 7:30 PM when you’ll be (should be) back in your home. That way you can ensure
                                    that your wife’s red letter day becomes memorable. So, the order scheduling feature
                                    is truly very useful in certain situations.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Live order tracking:&nbsp;</u></i>This is perhaps the most elaborate, advanced,
                                    and important feature in the customer app. It provides live order status updates to
                                    customers via in-app notifications.</p>

                                <p>Users can also track the location and movement of their respective delivery
                                    executives in the food delivery app. This feature keeps customers informed and
                                    prevents anxiety for them.</p>

                                    Even the Cash on Delivery (CoD) payment option is available to accommodate orthodox
                                    customers.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Ratings and reviews:&nbsp;</u></i>Food delivery apps enable customers to give
                                    their ratings and reviews for the food orders delivered. This is an effective way
                                    for food aggregator businesses to know which restaurants are performing well and
                                    which restaurants are not and address the ones that are not performing well.</p>

                                <p>This feature also enables customers to voice out their suggestions and complaints
                                    regarding the respective food orders delivered and ensure that they get the quality
                                    of product and service they had paid for.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Reorder:&nbsp;</u></i>Food delivery apps these days are very smart. They save
                                    customers’ past orders and preferences so that if customers think of reordering the
                                    same, they can do so by just clicking the ‘Reorder’ button. The reorder feature
                                    saves a lot of time and effort for customers.</p>

                                <p><i><u>Offers and loyalty programs:</u></i>&nbsp;This is the feature that customers
                                    like the most because it enables them to save a lot of money. If your online food
