                            <h2>The Different Types Of Enterprise Mobile Applications</h2>

                            <h3 id="1">Employee Level Apps</h3>
                            <p>Employee level apps are usually customized for each and every employee. They are
                                basically apps that enable employees to update the status of the tasks assigned to them.
                                Some employee apps may even contain business analytics tools so that the concerned
                                employees can prepare and share business performance reports.</p>
                            <p>Employee level apps are usually customized because employees’ designations and roles vary
                                greatly in an organization and so will the procedure to update the statuses of their
                                tasks.</p>
                            <p>For example some high rank employees in an organization may do complex tasks that consist
                                of various phases and each of those task phases have to be updated separately. Some
                                employees may have to prepare more elaborate and complex business performance reports.
                                So their respective customized official apps will have more sophisticated and elaborate
                                business analytics tools.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Department Level Apps</h3>
                            <p>Department level apps are the most varied and customized official apps you’ll come
                                across. They are tailor-made to cater to the requirements of every department in every
                                organization. The types of department level apps are listed below.</p>
                            <p><u>Staff coordination apps:</u> These apps enable a company’s staff to communicate and
                                coordinate with each other on a real time basis. These apps usually enable live chat,
                                messages, and file sharing.</p>
                            <p>Via these coordination apps, a company’s staff from various departments can communicate
                                and coordinate with each other to finish the allotted official tasks and update the
                                statuses of their respective official tasks.</p>
                            <p><u>Marketing apps:</u> These apps enable the marketing and sales departments in any firm
                                to devise marketing strategies, schemes, offers, and customer loyalty programs. These
                                official apps help enhance the reach, lead conversion rate, business volume, and profit
                                of any business.</p>
                            <p><u>CRM apps:</u> These apps provide all the necessary and relevant details of all the

                                red-letter days, their tastes and preferences, their buying trends, etcetera.</p>
                            <p>Using all these business insights and data, businesses can wish their customers on their
                                red letter days and devise effective business strategies to heighten their customer
                                engagement, customer retention, and brand loyalty.</p>
                            <p><u>Financial apps:</u> These apps help a company remain compliant with some of the local
                                government’s statutory laws. They help an organization correctly maintain its balance
                                sheets and accounts. Swift and secure online official payments are also possible via
                                official finance apps.</p>
                            <p><u>Logistics control apps:</u> These apps help an organization keep track of and control

                                been delivered to its client or customer, communicating and coordinating with their
                                truck drivers, etcetera so that the organization can keep its business operations
                                running smoothly.</p>
                            <p><u>HR apps:</u> These apps enable a company’s HR to view and evaluate the resumes of the
                                company’s candidates. They also enable HRs to communicate with their candidates and
                                update the status of their job applications. Last but not least, these apps enable HRs
                                to keep track of their selection process.</p>
                            <p><u>Partner apps:</u> Some businesses don’t hire full-time employees at least not for all
                                their departments. They instead hire business partners to aid them in providing their
                                service or selling their products.</p>
                            <p>Business partners don’t get paid a fixed salary unlike regular employees. Instead, they
                                get paid according to the amount of work they do. Partner apps help businesses keep
                                track of their partners’ business activities and payments made to them.</p>
                            <p><u>Industry news apps:</u> These apps are not like your regular news apps. They provide
                                entrepreneurs with the latest news pertaining to their industry. Entrepreneurs can also
                                cutomize/filter in which sub-domain they wish to receive news updates on.</p>
                            <h3 id="3">Company Level Apps</h3>
                            <p>Company level apps are the final app products that companies sell to their customers or
                                clients. Some organizations may even have their own dedicated training apps to train new
                                joinees in their various departments.</p>
                            <h2>What Are The Challenges In Undertaking Enterprise Mobile App Development?</h2>
                            <p>It might be surprising to know but even in modern times, corporations face challenges
                                while designing mobile apps for official or commercial purposes. Some of the major
                                challenges that organizations face while designing mobile apps are as listed below.</p>
                            <h3 id="4">Not Knowing The Needs Of The Target Audience</h3>
                            <p>Some companies do not invest the time and effort in getting to know the needs of their
                                target audience thoroughly. Hence, they end up designing apps that their target audience
                                don’t need.</p>
                            <p>Apps that are not in demand will never get many downloads even if they are marketed well.
                                Before designing an app, app developers should ask themselves these questions:</p>

                            <li>What is the purpose of designing the app?</li>
                            <li>Is the app’s design purpose aligned with the requirements of our target audience?</li>
                            <li>What are the features and functionalities that need to be incorporated into the app to
                                fulfill its design purpose?</li>
                            <li>Are there any extra and unique features that can be incorporated into the app to
                                heighten
                                users’ convenience and engagement?</li>
                            <li>Is the app’s design/wireframe appealing, engaging, advanced, and easy to use?</li>
                            <br>
                            <h3 id="5">Disgruntled Design Team Due To Paltry Pay</h3>
                            <p>While the quality of the work/final product is impotant, it is equally important to pay
                                your app design and marketing team satisfactorily to ensure the commitment of your
                                employees to the app design project lest your employees will become disgruntled and do
                                shoddy and sketchy work on the project which will ultimately lead to your app not
                                selling. Hence, you must set an appropriate budget for your project before beginning
                                work on it.</p>

                            <h3 id="6">Having Only Inexperienced App Developers In Your Team</h3>
                            <p>While freshers in the app development domain are the best in coming up with innovative
                                app design ideas, they perform relatively poorly when it comes to understanding what
                                needs to be done and employing the best app design practices.</p>
                            <p>Hence, your app development team should ideally consist of 75% experienced professionals
                                and 25% freshers in the app development domain to incorporate the right blend of
                                internationally recognized app design practices and innovation in app design. High
                                performance and innovative apps are always the ones that get the maximum number of
                                downloads and positive user reviews.</p>
                            <h3 id="7">Low Level Of Data Security</h3>
                            <p>The security level of an app is as important as its performance and layout. After all,
                                nobody likes their data leaked/compromised. An app that has a low level of data security
                                will make its data structure prone to malware and hacking attacks and thereby compromise
                                its users’ data.</p>
                            <p>Once you lose the trust of your users by compromising their data or by tinkering with
                                their data privacy, it’s very hard if not impossible to gain back their trust and usage
                                of your app. So, high importance has to be given to data security and privacy while
                                designing your app.</p>
                            <h3 id="8">Designing An Unappealing And Cumbersome App</h3>
                            <p>No matter how great the performance of your app is, if your app is not easy to navigate
                                and has very palin and unappealing design, you will not get many downloads for your app
                                and will thereby not make much revenue and profits from it.</p>
                            <p>People always like and prefer to use only attractive and easy to navigate apps. Research
                                has proven that the UI/UX of an app is as important as its performance and features.</p>
                            <h3 id="9">No Backup Available</h3>
                            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut elit tellus, luctus necaThese
                                days, personal data is as precious to people as money. People prefer to download apps
                                that automatically backup their data for later retrieval and use. Users may need their
                                backed up data in case their app or smartphone crashes or get damaged. Users may also
                                need their past data for current reference and use. ullamcorper mattis, pulvinar dapibus

                            <h3 id="10">Inappropriate And Ineffective App Marketing</h3>
                            <p>Before marketing your app via online social media platforms, the unique characteristics
                                and the advantages and disadvantages of each social media platform has to be understood
                                fully. You then need to choose the appropriate social media platforms and <a

                            <p>Even if your app has been stunningly designed, the efforts of your design team will go in
                                vain if your app is not marketed properly. After all, only if your app has been marketed
                                properly, it will sell and give you revenue and profits and only if you get good revenue
                                and profits, you will be able to pay your staff their salaries and incentives.</p>
                            <h2>How Much Does Enterprise App Development Cost?</h2>
                            <p>Unfortunately or fortunately, there is no definite answer to this question. The cost to
                                develop an app for your business depends on a multitude of factors as listed below.</p>
                            <h3 id="11">Number And Complexity Of The Desired App Features</h3>
                            <p>Obviously, the more the number of app features you want, the more development time it’s
                                going to take and the more it’ll cost you. If you want advanced and complex features to
                                be installed in app, then too it’s going to cost you more as developing complicated and
                                elaborate app features requires a great deal of technical expertise and app development
                                time.</p>

                            <p>A simple app interface will only cost you an average of around USD 4,000 to design
                                whereas a swanky and feature-rich UI that is versatile yet simple to use will cost you
                                between USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 to design. Advanced yet simple to use UIs have a higher
                                user engagement rate when compared to simple UIs.</p>
                            <h3 id="13">The Nationality And Experience Of App Developers</h3>
                            <p>Experienced app developers will obviously charge you more for their app development
                                services as they have more proven technical experience and expertise whereas freshers in
                                the app development domain will be a lot less expensive to hire as they’ll be facing
                                high competition, yearning to get good app development projects, and have to prove
                                themselves first before they increase their hourly rates.</p>
                            <p>App developers from different regions of the world also charge variedly for their app
                                development services.</p>
                            <p>App developers from developed nations like the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, etcetera
                                charge more for their app development services when compared to app developers from
                                developing nations like India, China, Malaysia, etcetera.</p>
                            <p>This could be due to stiffer competition in developing countries for high-paying,
                                white-collar jobs like mobile app development. The table below shows the average per
                                hour rates of mobile app developers in various nations.</p>
                            <p><u>The US:</u> Mobile app developers from the US are the costliest to hire. Their average
                                hourly
                                charge ranges between USD 50 to USD 250. This could be due to the sparse competition in
                                the US in the mobile app development domain and also due to the high technical expertise
                                of mobile app developers there.</p>
                            <p><u>Europe:</u> European app developers may be costly or cheap to hire. Their hourly app
                                development charge varies widely between USD 30 to USD 150.</p>
                            <p>You may hire a cost-effective European app developer depending on your budget and app
                                functionality requirements but kindly ensure that you get value for your money and not a
                                poorly designed app that will bodge the public image and reputation of your restaurant
                                business.</p>
                            <p><u>Australia:</u> App developers from Australia are somewhat expensive to hire. They
                                charge
                                anywhere from USD 80 to USD 120 per hour for their app development services.</p>
                            <p><u>India:</u> Indian app developers are the most sought-after by firms around the world.
                                This is
                                because they are skilled yet <a

                                    to hire</a> to hire. Indian app developers charge only between USD 10 to USD 80 per
                                hour for their app development services. This could be due to the exceptionally high
                                competition in India to secure high paying, white collar jobs like mobile app
                                development.</p>

                            <h3 id="14">The App Development Platform Used</h3>
                            <p>Different app development platforms and coding languages are used to develop native or
                                cross-platform apps for Android or iOS. The “Kotlin” programming language is used to
                                develop native Android apps. The “Swift” programming language is used to develop native
                                iOS apps.</p>
                            <p>Certain app development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter are used to
                                develop cross-platform apps. The employ different app coding technologies like
                                Javascript, C#.net, and Dart respectively to design cross-platform apps.</p>
                            <p>The different coding technologies differ in their capabilities (the functionality of the
                                respective features) and complexity. Hence, app developers using different app
                                development platforms and coding technologies charge varied hourly rates for their app
                                development services.</p>
                            <p>Generally speaking, designing an official app for your business will cost you anywhere
                                between USD 5,000 to USD 200,000 depending on the above-mentioned factors.</p>
