                            <h2>Why Android Apps Are Still Trending And Used Globally</h2>
                            <p>As of today, Android apps are used globally while <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/iphone-application/">iOS
                                    apps</a> are mostly used only in the US. Android apps currently hold about 74% of
                                the app market share while iOS apps hold only about 25% of the app market share. The
                                remaining measly 1% of the app market share is held by Fuschia and others. The major
                                reasons for the far greater popularity and usage of Android apps globally are as listed
                                below.</p>

                            <h3 id="1"> Google Had Introduced The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) Policy In 2007</h3>
                            <p>To compete with Apple’s iphones and iOS, Google in 2007 had introduced the Open Handset
                                Alliance (OHA) policy. It had also officially announced that the Android OS would be
                                employed in the smartphones manufactured by it. </p>
                            <p>The OHA policy meant that any smartphone manufacturing company was free to adopt Android
                                as its smartphones’ OS whereas Apple did not make the license for its iOS, opensource.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hence, a lot of smartphone manufacturing firms including giants in the industry like
                                Samsung, Oppo, Redmi, Lava, etcetera had adopted the Android OS in their smartphones
                                thus contributing to the global popularity and usage of the Android OS.</p>
                            <h3 id="2">Android Smartphones Are More Cost Effective Than Iphones And Ipads</h3>
                            <p>Even a person who’s not tech savvy in any corner of the world would tell you that the
                                “budget Android smartphone” is definitely far more cost effective than the “budget
                                iphone”. Hence, the Android OS and Android smartphones sell much more than iphones,
                                ipads, and the iOS. Till date, Apple’s exclusivity based marketing has not been able to
                                compete effectively with Google’s affordable smartphone solutions. </p>
                            <h3 id="3">The Android OS Can Be Run On Pretty Much Any Smartphone</h3>
                            <p>The Android OS has a simple yet efficient working mechanism. It can be installed and run
                                on almost all types of smartphones and other smart devices. It can even be installed and
                                run on iphones and ipads if somebody was skilled enough to do it. </p>
                            <p>Many smart devices like smartwatches and other smart devices use the Android OS. Hence,
                                transfer of files and data is easily possible between various Android smart devices.
                            </p>
                            <p>Moreover Android smart devices have a lot of hardware compatibility. For example, the
                                charger used to charge your Android smartphone can also be used to charge your Android
                                smartwatch and so on. This level of hardware compatibility and flexibility is lacking in
                                the iOS ecosystem. </p>
                            <h3 id="4">Android’s AI Has Caught Up With The IOS In Features And Sophistication</h3>
                            <p>iOS and its apps initially had a higher degree of software sophistication than Android
                                and its apps. Virtual assistants like iOS’s “Siri” was one of the major types of
                                sophisticated software that Android smartphones and other Android smart devices lacked
                                in. </p>
                            <p>However, Google had launched its own virtual assistant in 2016 thus bridging the gap in
                                user experience (UX) that Android smartphones and other smart Android devices had with
                                Apple’s smart devices. </p>
                            <p>Google has now developed Android’s AI so much that Android can now support even very
                                advanced and graphics-heavy applications. The edge in mobile hardware technology that
                                Apple once enjoyed is now ebbing away as cutting edge Android smartphones with
                                uber-efficient hardware technologies are now being developed by giants in the smartphone
                                manufacturing industry like Samsung, Oppo, HTC, Lava, etc.</p>
                            <p>In other words, the Android OS is now on par with the iOS in terms of sophistication,
                                complex app support capability, and efficiency of working.</p>

                            <h3 id="5">There’s A Greater Number And Variety Of Android Smartphones Out There Than
                                Iphones And Ipads</h3>
                            <p>Iphones and ipads are manufactured only by Apple, which normally releases two to three
                                models of iphones and three to four models of ipads every year. This means that if one
                                is not satisfied with the new releases of Apple’s iphones and ipads, he or she will have
                                to wait about a year to try the next models. </p>
                            <p>This is not the case with Android smartphones and other Android smart devices. Google’s
                                OHC policy allows smartphone manufacturers to manufacture any kind of hardware for
                                Android smartphones. </p>
                            <p>Therefore, there is a far greater number and variety of Android smartphones out there
                                than iphones or ipads. The availability of far greater smartphone buying options in
                                terms of brands and models for Android users at any given point of time prevents
                                disappointments for them and makes shopping for Android smart devices, a pleasurable
                                experience. </p>
                            <p>An example of this is the flip model of Android smartphones that Samsung had introduced
                                about a decade ago. Flip model iphones (both horizontal and vertical) were not available
                                back then and are still not available. This just goes to show how spoilt Android users
                                are for choices when it comes to buying Android smartphones and other Android smart
                                devices.</p>

                            <h3 id="6">Development Of Cross-Platform Apps</h3>
                            <p>Cross platform apps are those apps that can run on the Android OS as well as the iOS. The
                                discovery of the possibility of developing cross-platform apps was ground-breaking about
                                seven years back because cross-platform apps take the least amount of development time
                                and maintenance. </p>
                            <p>Generally, mathematical analysis apps, business analytics apps, on-demand delivery apps,
                                gaming apps, and AR and VR apps are cross-platform apps. </p>
                            <p>Cross-platform apps can be developed using either of these three popular cross-platform
                                app development kits. They use different front end and back end <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/latest-mobile-app-development-technologies-for-startups-2022/">coding
                                    technologies to develop cross platform apps</a>, which are listed below.</p>
                            <p>Flutter: The Flutter cross-platform app development kit was released by Google in May
                                2017. It employs the Dart programming language to develop the frontend user interface
                                section of the app. It then employs the upgraded version of the C++ coding technology to
                                design backend app functionalities. Cross-platform apps designed using Flutter are
                                renowned for their swift and seamless performance. </p>
                            <p>Xamarin: The Xamarin cross-platform app development kit was released by Microsoft in
                                February 2016. It uses the C# coding technology to design frontend and backend app
                                features and functionalities. Xamarin is especially good when it comes to designing
                                gaming apps due to the vast predefined libraries that C# has. ‘Skulls of the Shogun’ is
                                one of the most popular gaming app designed using Xamarin. </p>
                            <p>React Native: This cross-platform app development kit was released by Meta Platforms Inc.
                                in March 2015. It uses React JS (Javascript) to design frontend app features and Node JS
                                to design backend app functionalities. </p>
                            <p>React Native was the first globally popular cross-platform app development kit to be
                                released into the market. The design and release of this platform happened after one of
                                Facebook’s engineers named Jordan Walke discovered that the web programming language,
                                Javascript can be used to design cross-platform apps that retained about 90% of their
                                source code when switching from Android to iOS and vice versa.</p>
                            <h3 id="7">Development Of AI And Machine Learning Based Apps</h3>
                            <p>As smartphones and other smart and computing devices become more advanced, the Artificial
                                Intelligence (AI) technology is gaining prominence and widespread usage. Many apps in
                                every category have now become AI-based. </p>
                            <p>For example, Prisma and Face App are two popular AI-based photo editing apps. Many
                                booking apps now have chat bots and voice search features built into them that are based
                                on the AI technology. </p>
                            <p>Many messaging apps, live chat apps, future sales and business environment predicting
                                apps, food delivery apps, etcetera make use of the Machine Learning (ML) technology for
                                their operations.</p>

                            <h3 id="8">Usage Of The Android Jetpack</h3>
                            <p>The Android Jetpack is a more advanced native Android app development platform than
                                Android Studio versions. It has a vast collection of predefined libraries, advanced
                                native Android app development tools, and the latest Android app development guidelines
                                to create a better app development experience for native Android app developers. Hence,
                                it has become popular and widely used these days.</p>
                            <p>The Android Jetpack has the Kotlin coding technology integrated into it to enable the
                                development of native Android apps. It also has built-in tools that enables Android app
                                developers to maintain and upgrade their Android apps with ease. It also has built-in
                                tools that enable in-app notifications to keep Android app users informed (KCI model).
                                Last but not least, the Android Jetpack has built-in tools that enable the creation of
                                simple yet engaging UIs for native Android apps.</p>
                            <h3 id="9">Development Of On-Demand Delivery Apps</h3>
                            <p>As the modern day lifestyle becomes ever more hectic and fast-paced, people are not
                                finding the time these days to do their daily chores like laundry, cooking food, grocery
                                shopping, shopping for fish and meat, etcetera. Hence, they have turned to on-demand
                                delivery apps to fulfill their daily chore needs. </p>
                            <p>Since Android smartphones are very popular and widely used in developing nations like
                                India, China, Malaysia, etcetera; most of the on-demand delivery apps these days are
                                native Android apps and are coded in Kotlin.</p>
                            <h3 id="10">Development Of IoT Technology Based Apps</h3>
                            <p>IoT stands for Internet of Things. It is one of the latest technologies developed by
                                mankind. The IoT technology enables smart devices of any kind to automatically
                                communicate with each other and exchange information among other tasks.</p>
                            <p>For example, your IoT enabled refrigerator and IoT enabled car may communicate with each
                                other. Your smart refrigerator can send you notifications on your smart car when your
                                groceries need to be replenished. The IoT technology greatly reduces the need for manual
                                labor in many walks of life and enables the automatic execution of many important tasks.
                            </p>
                            <p>Many apps, especially Android apps these days are IoT based. The IoT app market size is
                                expected to swell to USD 1.6 trillion by 2025. Edmodo, C-Pen, Nymi, etc. are some of the
                                most popular IoT based education apps. </p>
                            <p>Similarly, IoT based healthcare apps like Cultfit automatically send your periodic health
                                reports to your family doctor or health and fitness coach so that your health can be
                                monitored and maintained in perfect condition.</p>
