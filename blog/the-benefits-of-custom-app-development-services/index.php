                            <p>“Mobile apps” rather than “website” is the buzzword these days. Sure, from 1980 to 2010,
                                people enjoyed the services and convenience that desktops, laptops, and websites
                                provided but as smartphones and mobile apps started gaining popularity after 2010,
                                especially in developing nations like India, China, Brazil, Malaysia, etcetera; people
                                started using mobile phones and mobile apps in every walk of their lives rather than
                                desktops or laptops. This is because mobile phones and mobile apps provide a far geater
                                level of mobility and flexibility than PC applications. Since mobile phones and mobile
                                apps are globally popular these days, almost every organization in every industry
                                already has or is trying to develop an official app of its own to improve its business
                                in all aspects. The average person spends about 5 hours on mobile apps every day. So,
                                you must capitalize on this opportunity and try to develop a customized mobile app for
                                your business as soon as possible. The numerous advantages of developing a customized
                                mobile app is described in detail in this blog post. So, kindly read on to know more.

                            <h2>The Numerous Benefits Of Custom Mobile App Development
                            </h2>
                            <p>Developing a customized mobile app (native or hybrid app) for your business will give you
                                numerous benefits. If the ideal official app is developed, it is sure to take your
                                business to the next level and improve it in all aspects. Given below are some of the
                                major benefits of developing a customized mobile app for your business.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="1">It will heighten your brand awareness</h3>
                            <p>Mobile apps are the easiest, most convenient, and the quickest way to leverage the global
                                reach and influence of the internet. If you develop an official app for your business
                                and it ranks on Play Store or The App Store or both, your business will certainly be
                                visible to your target audience regionally or globally (as you desire) and that will
                                heighten your brand awareness, lead conversion rate, business volume, and profits.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="2">Coordination Between Employees Of An Organization Is Easier</h3>
                            <p>Though desktops and laptops are comparable to smartphones in computing power, mobile
                                phones and mobile apps enable your organization’s employees to work and coordinate in a
                                much more mobile and flexible manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mobile phones and mobile apps are definitely a lot more convenient to use than PC
                                applications. Since impeccable and efficient coordination is key for an organization’s
                                success and growth, it is advisable to have an official app for your organization where
                                your employees can work and coordinate with each other in a swift, seamless, flexible,
                                and convenient manner. Companies that have an official app have been shown to have a
                                marginally higher employee satisfaction percentage than companies without one.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="3">You Will Have More Control Over The Features And Functionality Of Your App
                            </h3>
                            <p>Organizations that use a commercially available app for their business like WhatsApp will
                                have no control over the features and functionality of the app. They have to make do
                                with what features are available. They will also not have any control over the updates
                                made on the app. Hence, it’s always better to have your own customized official app for
                                your business to achieve granular control over all your business operations.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="4">It Makes Your Business Unique And Stand Out
                            </h3>
                            <p>Using a commercially available app for your business will drain out any creative juices
                                your technical team might have. Research has shown that organizations that nurture and
                                employ a high level of creativity in their business tasks are far more successful than
                                organizations that strictly adhere to their business processes/rules.
                            </p>
                            <p>Allowing your app development team to develop a customized and creative app for your
                                business will definitely make your business stand out, improve it in all aspects, and
                                catalyze the growth of your business.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="5">You Can Create A Secure Official App For Your Business
                            </h3>
                            <p>As far as any organization is concerned, data security is of utmost importance. Any
                                compromise in data security or leakage of confidential data will lead to a serious loss
                                of business volume and reputation.
                            </p>
                            <p>With commercially available apps, you have to make do with the provided standard of data
                                security. If it is breached by any chance, your official and confidential data could be
                                leaked or mal manipulated, leading to a multitude of problems for your business like how
                                Facebook’s users’ accounts were hacked a few years ago and Mark Zuckerberg had to appear
                                in court cases in the US. Data security and privacy compromise might even lead to the
                                closure of your business on legal grounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you develop a customized official app for your business, you will have total control
                                over the data security algorithms and protocols employed in your official app and you
                                can make your official app as secure as possible to preserve the integrity and
                                reputation of your business.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="6">You Can Earn Additional Revenue Via Your Official App
                            </h3>

                            <p>You can earn some additional revenue via your official app by releasing it in the app
                                market (app store) for a price. The more downloads your app gets, the more money you’ll
                                make.
                            </p>
                            <p>You can also earn money via in-app purchases and in-app ads. Your users will most likely
                                click on relevant ads and you’ll get commissions from Google Ad Sense thus augmenting
                                your company’s revenue. After all, who doesn’t like some extra cash?
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="7">You Can Get Valuable Customer Insights
                            </h3>
                            <p>If your company’s official app is a commercial app like Swiggy, you can use it to gain
                                valuable customer insights. This is because you can embed cutting-edge business
                                analytics tools in your customized official app.
                            </p>
                            <p>The customer analytical tool will give you valuable information like your customers’
                                buying trends and their product or service preferences. You can then use that
                                information to devise ever more effective business strategies to enhance your business
                                volume and profits. After all, most of the businesses in the world are customer centric
                                and understanding your customers is key to success in your business.
                            </p>
                            <h3 id="8">Your Business Processes Can Be Made More Efficient And Cost Effective
                            </h3>
                            <p>Communicating, coordinating, and sharing of official information and files is much easier
                                and faster via mobile apps than via PC applications. Hence, a customized official mobile
                                app can make your business processes much more efficient and effective. After all, in
                                the corporate world, time is money and money is too precious to lose.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Meta Data
                            </h3>
                            <p>Ever since the internet technology was invented, it has been growing in popularity,
                                usefulness, and effectiveness. As mobile phones and mobile apps started growing in usage
                                and popularity about a decade back especially in developing countries like India, China,
                                Malaysia, etcetera; they have become the preferred method by people and organizations to
                                leverage the global reach and influence of the internet. This is because mobile phones
                                and mobile apps offer a lot more conveniences and flexibility than desktop or laptop
                                applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hence, it has become imperative for organizations to use mobile apps for official
                                purposes. However, it is advisable to develop your own customized official app rather
                                than use commercially available apps for your business processes as in-house developed
                                customized apps give you total control over the app’s security standards, features, and
                                upgrades.
                            </p>
                            <p>In-house developed customized apps can be modified to suit your business requirements
                                rather than vice versa as it is in the case of commercial apps. Customized apps can make
                                your business processes more efficient and seamless thus saving you a lot of money in
                                the long run. They are also handy in heightening your brand awareness, helping you earn
                                more revenue, and giving you valuable business insights. Hence, you have everything to
                                gain and nothing to lose by developing an official customized app for your business.
