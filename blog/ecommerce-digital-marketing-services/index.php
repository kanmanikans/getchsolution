                            <!--Content starts-->
                            <p>Every organization, big or small, yearns for a digital presence these days. The reasons
                                for it are numerous.</p>
                            <p>Prominent among them are the advent of the pandemic and how it has affected the normal
                                functioning of businesses, the enormous reach, popularity, and influence of the
                                internet, and the ease with which businesses can promote their products or services
                                online and the pivotal role played by e-commerce digital marketing services in
                                navigating these challenges and opportunities.</p>
                            <p>It is the same scenario with the ecommerce industry. Since the advent of the pandemic,
                                people have become ever more health conscious. They are averse to going to crowded
                                outlets to purchase any kind of item.</p>
                            <p>They would rather have whatever they need, delivered to their doorsteps in a contactless
                                manner. This practice or preference of people has given a boost to ecommerce businesses
                                and has also helped curtail the spread of the infection</p>

                            <p>When the pandemic began spreading around the world in 2020, a lot of business outlets and
                                retail stores were closed due to the lockdown imposed in various nations and states.
                                Digital marketing helps e-commerce businesses thrive during these challenging times.</p>
                            <p>This situation caused ecommerce companies to experience a huge uptick in their business
                                volume and profits as people had become averse to going to crowded retail outlets and
                                other popular business forums (like movie theaters, auditoriums, etc.) to buy what they
                                want as the risk of incurring the infection was very high.</p>
                            <p>Even after the initial lockdowns were lifted, the Coronavirus had persisted in India and
                                elsewhere in the world by means of the second and third waves. Due to these waves,
                                people still are averse to going to crowded marketplaces to buy the stuff they need as
                                the chances of incurring an infection is still high. Moreover, people have discovered
                                and relish the convenience of e-commerce apps. So, the heydays of e-commerce apps have
                                not ended and are here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>
                            <p>The E-commerce giant, Amazon’s business volume in India had grown by 39% year-on-year
                                (YoY) since 2019 and that is saying something as Amazon’s business volume in India is
                                truly humongous (INR 11,400 crores) and for it to grow by 39% year-on-year is almost
                                miraculous.</p>
                            <p>Amazon’s augmented success story in India since 2019 is a beacon of hope to other
                                ecommerce organizations. It implies that if other e-commerce firms truly ampup their
                                efforts and promote their brand and services online, it will lead to heightened
                                conversion rates and thereby, more business volume and profits. Even converting people
                                into your e-commerce firm’s evangelists is not a far-fetched idea these days.</p>
                            <h2>Where Does An Ecommerce Digital Marketing Agency Come Into The Picture?</h2>
                            <p>Before the dawn of the 21st century, the only way companies could promote their products
                                or services was via traditional forms of advertising like newspaper ads, billboard ads,
                                sign board displays, advertisement on radio channels, TV (analog) ads, and ofcourse
                                word-of-mouth. These forms of advertisement were very costly, limited in their reach and
                                effectiveness, and not quantifiable in their success/results.</p>
                            <p>The whole situation has changed with the global growth and reach of the internet, the
                                growth of search engines of various types (like text and picture-based Google and
                                video-based YouTube, etcetera), the growth of various social media platforms, the
                                development of various digital marketing and business analytics tools, and the
                                increasing demand for services provided by an e-commerce digital marketing agency.</p>
                            <p>Businesses can now easily identify their target audience, make their ad campaigns more
                                effective by directing them only towards their target audience, and employ various
                                advanced business analytics tools to measure and streamline the effectiveness of their
                                ad campaigns.</p>
                            <p>Let’s now have a detailed overview of how ecommerce digital marketing services can boost
                                the reach, conversion rates, popularity, influence, business volume, and profits of
                                e-commerce firms.</p>
                            <h3>Leveraging The Reach And Effectiveness Of The Internet</h3>
                            <p>With today’s technology, businesses can leverage the reach (billions of people online)
                                and influence of the internet and promote their products or services with just the click
                                of a mouse button.</p>
                            <p>This convenience was not present before the dawn of the 21st century. Organizations had
                                to resort to strenuous, costly, and weakly effective forms of traditional advertising to
                                make themselves known to people and other businesses in their respective industries. In
                                this digital age, partnering with an e-commerce digital marketing agency has become
                                essential for businesses to thrive.</p>
                            <h3>Devising Effective Advertising Campaigns</h3>
                            <p>Almost every social media platform has an ad campaign manager feature these days and they
                                are really versatile too. For example: Facebook’s ad campaign manager has the A/B
                                testing feature that enables you to test two variations of your digital ad
                                simultaneously. You even get to control which geographical areas your digital
                                advertisement will be visible on along with many other useful controls.</p>
                            <p>A plethora of business analytics tools such as Google Analytics, Facebook’s ad campaign
                                manager, etcetera enable business owners to measure and optimize the performance of
                                their social media ad campaigns as well as the performance of their organization’s
                                official website like the number of hits it has received, its ad revenue, etcetera.</p>
                            <h3>Influencing The Purchase Decisions Of Your Customers</h3>
                            <p>By employing various domains of digital marketing like email marketing, designing and
                                using appealing infographics, Social Media Marketing (SMM), maintaining appealing
                                Facebook business pages, etcetera, you can influence the buying decision of your
                                customers in your favor. These domains of digital marketing will help you enhance your
                                conversion rates and thereby your brand’s popularity, business volume, and profits.</p>
                            <h3>Getting The Maximum ROI In The Minimal Time Period</h3>
                            <p>Social media ad campaigns are cost-effective but the most effective. They enable you to
                                effectively promote your products or services among your target audience instantly and
                                easily.</p>
                            <p>Social media ad campaign managers are so feature-rich yet simple to use that you can get
                                the best results out of them with the minimal effort on your part. They will surely give
                                you the maximum ROI in the minimal time period.</p>
                            <p>If you're not even willing to spend a penny to promote your products or services, you can
                                even promote your brand free of charge on the relevant groups in social media platforms.
                                This is unlike traditional forms of advertising (as mentioned before), which are costly,
                                labor heavy, weakly effective, not quantifiable, and where there is cut-throat
                                competition. So, kindly employ the above-mentioned e-commerce digital marketing strategy
                                wisely to take your e-commerce business to the next level. If you need expert guidance,
                                consider partnering with a reputable e-commerce digital marketing agency.</p>

                            <p>Search Engine Marketing (SEM) involves a set of tools, techniques, and strategies to make
                                your website rank on the first page of Google’s search results. It mainly involves
                                getting high quality backlinks to your web pages and website to raise their DA and PAs
                                so that your website ranks on the first page of Google’s search results and gains a
                                global online visibility.</p>
                            <p>You can also create a paid advertisement campaign on Google Ads and list your website on
                                the top portion of the first page of Google’s search results. Google Ads operates under
                                a pay-per-click (PPC) model.</p>
                            <p>This means that you determine the keywords that you want your e-commerce website to rank
                                for and pay for those keywords, everytime they get you a click via them. You set the
                                maximum amount that you’re willing to pay for a click.</p>
                            <p>If the amount determined by Google for a click on the chosen keyword is less than or
                                equal to your maximum amount, your e-commerce website will rank for that keyword.</p>
                            <p>If the amount determined by Google for a click on the chosen keyword is greater than your
                                maximum amount, you can’t afford to pay for that click and your e-commerce website will
                                not rank for that keyword.For e-commerce digital marketing services, this budget
                                constraint can impact your online visibility and advertising strategy. </p>

                            <p>Social Media Marketing (SMM) means to promote your brand, your products, or your services
                                on various social media platforms to elevate your brand awareness, conversion rates,
                                business volume, and ultimately, your profits.</p>
                            <p>Your brand, products, or services can be promoted on relevant groups free of charge or
                                you can run paid advertising campaigns on various social media platforms like Facebook
                                to promote your brand, products, or services.</p>
                            <p>As far as Facebook is concerned, it has many types of ads that you can run like image
                                ads, carousel ads, video ads, slideshow ads, etcetera. Whatever the ad type or platform
                                you’re running it on, you need to determine which of these three is the goal of your ad
                                campaign, before launching it.</p>
                            <p><u>Brand awareness:</u> Here, you’re trying to promote your brand and its products or
                                services
                                on relevant social media platforms to grab the attention of people and create an
                                awareness about your brand. Once you have set the filters on your ad campaign, your
                                brand will be promoted in your desired geographical area and among the appropriate
                                target audience as determined by Facebook, considering various factors.</p>
                            <p><u>Lead generation and conversion:</u> Among your target audience, you would have
                                identified
                                people who are somewhat interested in purchasing your products or subscribing for your
                                service/s. They are known as leads. You gather leads’ details either by manual or
                                automated means and follow up with them, mostly via calls or emails. Some leads might
                                convert and buy your products or subscribe for your services. Others might opt out
                                halfway.</p>
                            <p><u>Expanding your brand evangelist network:</u> Evangelists are people who have already
                                experienced your products or services and they loved it. These are people who vouch for
                                your brand at their own discretion/free will. They are not paid to do so. You can give
                                your brand evangelists some goodies or other incentives to further spread the word of
                                your brand or to convert your existing customers into brand evangelists. Evangelists

                            <h3>Enthralling Questions On Digital Marketing</h3>
                            <h4>1. What kind of roles does Digital Marketing usually involve?</h4>
                            <p>Digital Marketing is a vast domain. It employs a lot of roles but the most common ones
                                are that of:</p>
                            <p><u>Project Manager:</u> This person will be in charge of getting your project completed
                                successfully. He will carefully make a note of all of your project requirements and
                                business goals. He will coordinate with you on behalf of his Digital Marketing team
                                every step of the way to ensure that your project requirements are perfectly met.</p>
                            <p><u>Accounts Manager:</u> This person will ensure that your budget is utilized in the most
                                effective manner that will enable you to get the maximum ROI. The accounts manager will
                                carefully monitor all the paid advertising campaigns that are run on various social
                                media platforms for you.</p>
                            <p><u>UI/UX designer:</u> This person will ensure that your app, in this case an e-commerce
                                app,
                                has an attractive, engaging, yet simple UI so that your customers can navigate through
                                your app easily and find what they’re looking for. This person indirectly ensures that
                                you get the maximum user retention.</p>
                            <p><u>App developer:</u> This person is the backbone of your e-commerce app development
                                project. He
                                will design a sophisticated yet simple to use e-commerce app, according to your
                                specifications so that you can promote your e-commerce app with ease on various social
                                media platforms.</p>
                            <p><u>Social Media Marketer:</u> This is yet another important role. This person gives the
                                finishing touches to your e-commerce app development project.
                                He ensures that your app/brand is promoted well on various social media platforms either
                                via paid ad campaigns or via free group postings, depending on your specifications.
                                He will ensure that your e-commerce app gets the maximum possible downloads and usage
                                once it’s listed on various app stores. You might say, he’s like the sales person for
                                your app.</p>

                            <h4>2. Is there any desirable frequency to promote my service or product on various social
                                media platforms?</h4>
                            <p>This is a tricky question and it all depends on which social media platform you’re using
                                to promote your product or service. Various social media platforms have various
                                desirable promotional frequencies. They are:
                            </p>
                            <p><u>Facebook:</u> The desirable promotional frequency for this “mother of all social media
                                platforms” is once a day or at least thrice a week (every alternate day).</p>
                            <p><u>Twitter:</u> Twitter’s desirable promotional frequency ranges vastly between 3 to 30
                                tweets
                                per day, depending on the type of product or service you’re trying to promote.</p>
                            <p><u>Instagram:</u> Instagram’s desirable promotional frequency is once or twice a day.</p>
                            <p><u>LinkedIn:</u> The desirable promotional frequency for LinkedIn is twice a week but
                                definitely
                                not more than once a day to maintain the professionalism of the platform.</p>

                            <h4>3. What is inbound marketing?</h4>
                            <p>Inbound marketing means promoting high-quality and relevant content among your target
                                audience that will answer their queries or provide the product or service they’re
                                looking for. It is the stark opposite of spamming people with irrelevant and low-quality
                                or objectionable content.
                            </p>

                            <h4>4. Is email marketing still relevant and effective?</h4>
                            <p>Ofcourse! Email is still a widely used professional medium of communication. Email
                                marketing can be used to heighten your conversion rates and even convert a portion of
                                your target audience into your brand evangelists.</p>
                            <p>Promotional emails should be highly personalized and convey your message in an appealing
                                and polite manner. Only then will they be effective.
                            </p>

                            <h4>5. Is buying an email list advisable?</h4>
                            <p>No, absolutely not! Buying email lists is just another way of spamming random people with
                                irrelevant advertisements or promotions!</p>
                            <p>You would be advised to organically grow your email subscribers by only appealing to your
                                target audience and employing appropriate digital marketing techniques. Only
                                personalized and relevant emails to people who really need your products or service will
                                get you any conversions.</p>

                            <h4>6. What’s the biggest mistake digital marketers make?</h4>
                            <p>They don’t focus on brand awareness campaigns enough. They try to sell their products or
                                services on relevant social media groups right away, which leads to little success.</p>
                            <p>They are also not persistent enough in their email campaigns for conversions. They do not
                                put in enough effort to take a person all through the conversion funnel.</p>

                            <h4>7. Which form of content is better? Short form or long form?</h4>
                            <p>Short form of content, which will mostly be promotional content, is more apt for social
                                media platforms where people don’t have time to go through lengthy posts. Long form of
                                content is more appropriate for blog posts because in Google’s view, the more you write
                                on a particular topic, the more expertised it thinks you are.</p>

                            <h4>8. What encourages people to read further on blog posts or social media posts?</h4>
                            <p>Intriguing headings and subheadings make people curious enough to read further. The
                                reputation of your brand or website also plays a significant role as people expect good
                                content and will generally be inclined to read the content on reputed websites in
                                various industries.</p>
                            <p>One thing is for sure, your subscribers will surely read the content on your website. So,
                                put your best foot forward to get more people to subscribe for your website or services.
                            </p>
