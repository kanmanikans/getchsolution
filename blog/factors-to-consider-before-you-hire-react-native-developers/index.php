                            <p>Mobile apps are “da bomb” these days. This is because they are one ofthe most advanced,
                                versatile, and convenient applications ever invented by mankind. Mobile apps are used by
                                organizations as well as people for a wide array of purposes. They are used in almost
                                every walk of life. Mobile app developers these days prefer developing cross-platform
                                apps rather than native Android or iOS apps because they’ll be able to cover (sell their
                                apps to) Android as well as iphone users if they develop hybrid apps. Xamarin, React
                                Native, and Flutter are the world’s most popular app development platforms used to
                                develop cross-platform apps. Among the three, the React Native hybrid app development
                                platform is the most popular and widely used because it uses variants of the Javascript
                                coding technology namely React JS (used in front end app development) and Node JS (used
                                in back end app development) to design hybrid apps. Javascript is a relatively easy and
                                familiar web coding technology among programmers hence React Native is the most popular
                                hybrid app development platform among the three. If you’re looking to hire React Native
                                developers for your interim app development needs, there are certain factors that you
                                should consider which is what we’ll be discussing in this article. So, kindly read on.

                            <h2>Factors To Consider Before You Hire Dedicated React Native Developers</h2>
                            <p>The primary responsibilities of a React Native developer include but are not limited to
                                developing a swift and seamless hybrid app, designing an attractive and engaging User
                                Interface (UI) for the cross-platform app, and getting the app tested under all possible
                                use cases. Following are proven methods to hire a proficient React Native developer.</p>

                            <h3 id="1">He Must Be Proficient In React Javascript</h3>
                            <p>React Javascript (JS) is a variant of the Javascript web coding technology used to design
                                front end app interfaces and features. Your React JS developer must obviously be
                                thorough with the React JS web design programming language to design hybrid apps
                                impeccably.</p>
                            <p>Your React JS developer must not only be thorough with React JS; he must also understand
                                the programming language’s underlying working mechanisms thoroughly to be able to design
                                swift and seamless hybrid apps.</p>

                            <h3>He Must Be Able To Design Highly Customized Hybrid Apps</h3>
                            <p>Your React JS developer must be well versed with certain components of the React JS
                                programming language like JSX, Virtual DOM, etcetera to be able to build highly
                                customized hybrid apps. The ability to build highly complex and customized apps is what
                                distinguishes React JS developers from GUI-based app developers.</p>

                            <h3>He Must Be Thorough With The Concept Of Functions In Javascript</h3>
                            <p>Javascript is a modularized Object Oriented Programming language (OOP) that makes use of
                                functions to enable various app functionalities. These functions often communicate with
                                one another or pass values between one another to achieve some common goals. </p>
                            <p>Hence, a thorough understanding of the concept of functions in React JS is necessary to
                                design modularized and seamless hybrid apps. You must ensure that your React JS
                                developer is well versed with the concept of functions in React JS.</p>


                            <h3>He Must Be Able To Incorporate Changes In Project Requirements</h3>
                            <p>It is only natural that most of the time, your clients’ project requirements change
                                midway through the development of the project. Hence, you must ensure that your React JS
                                developer has a good typing speed, can understand the changes in your clients’
                                requirements clearly, and can implement them satisfactorily. This level of adaptability
                                is vital to safeguard the reputation of your app development agency.</p>

                            <h3>Knowledge Of App Testing Is Preferable</h3>
                            <p>Proper functioning of your hybrid apps is necessary to preserve the integrity and
                                reputation of your app development agency. If your React JS developer has a sound
                                knowledge of app testing methods, that would be desirable because the smallest lapse in
                                the proper functioning of your app can lead to your customers not being able to execute
                                certain orders and thereby causing them to become frustrated and dissatisfied with your
                                app. </p>
                            <p>Your app must be tested under all use cases and on various performance parameters to
                                ensure the swift and seamless functioning of your app. If this step is overlooked or not
                                performed properly, the integrity, reputation, and future business prospects of your app
                                development agency will all go for a toss.</p>

                            <h3>He Must Be Able To Integrate Third Party Software Seamlessly</h3>
                            <p>Very often, integration of genuine third party software in any kind of app is necessary
                                for the overall smooth and seamless functioning of the app. An example of a type of
                                third party software required for apps is payment gateways. They enable and validate
                                users’ online payments for various purposes. </p>
                            <p>Your React JS developer should be adept at seamlessly integrating various third party
                                software with your cross-platform apps so that they can work efficiently and flawlessly
                                all the time. This will lead to heightened customer satisfaction and retention.</p>

                            <h3>An Appetite To Keep Learning All The Time</h3>
                            <p>While it is important to confirm to internationally recognized app development practices,
                                your React JS developer should not be afraid to be creative in his work. He must have a
                                sporting nature to learn from his mistakes and do better the next time. He must never
                                assume that he knows everything in React JS and must always have an open mind to learn
                                new things. Only then he and your company can grow together.</p>
