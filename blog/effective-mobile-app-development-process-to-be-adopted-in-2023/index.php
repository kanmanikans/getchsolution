                            <p>Mobile apps are “da bomb” these days. This is because mobile apps can be used anywhere
                                and anytime as they are installed on light-weight and portable smartphones unlike
                                websites that are usually accessed via desktops or laptops which are not as portable as
                                smartphones. Mobile apps are used by people for a wide array of purposes. Prominent
                                among them are on-demand delivery apps to meet daily requirements. That being the case,
                                you might be curious to know about the processes involved in mobile app development
                                process . If
                                so, kindly read on because that’s exactly what we’re going to discuss in this blog post.

                            <h2>The Growth Of Mobile Apps The Detailed Process Of Developing An App</h2>
                            <p>Mobile apps have witnessed an exponential increase in their usage worldwide ever since
                                the <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/latest-mobile-app-development-technologies-for-startups-2022/">smartphone
                                    technology started rapidly advancing</a> since the beginning of 2014. Mobile apps
                                had about 1.4 trillion users in 2016.</p>
                            <p>That number grew to 2.18 trillion by the end of 2020. The projected rise in the number of
                                app users worldwide is 2.58 trillion by the end of this year (2022). That’s a whopping
                                83% increase in user base in just six years!</p>
                            <p>Research has shown that the average person spends about 3 hours and 10 minutes everyday
                                checking his smartphone. Out of that time, 2 hours and 51 minutes are spent on browsing
                                apps. Netizens on the other hand check their smartphones and apps every 10 minutes! This
                                just goes to show how smartphones and mobile apps have become an integral part of our
                                lives.</p>
                            <p>Mobile apps greatly benefit businesses too. The revenue that businesses got from mobile
                                apps during 2014 was USD 97.7 billion. That number increased exponentially to USD 5.82
                                trillion by the end of 2020. Then it swelled to USD 6.93 trillion by the end of 2021.
                                The revenue from mobile apps is expected to balloon to USD 8.1 trillion by the end of
                                this year (2022) and USD 9.35 trillion by the end of 2023.</p>
                            <p>Clearly, both people and businesses benefit a lot from mobile apps. That’s the reason
                                many firms have taken their businesses online by building their official apps and
                                websites.</p>

                            <h2>The Effective Mobile App Development Process Steps</h2>
                            <p>The ultimate objective of <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/">developing a
                                    mobile app</a> is to satisfy the business requirements of the client. Hence,
                                attention has to be paid to every small detail stated by the client. Consequently, the
                                app development process is elaborate yet efficient and free of flaws. The app
                                development process is as stated below.</p>
                            <h3 id="1">Requirement Analysis</h3>
                            <p>In this phase of the app development process, the client’s requirements are analyzed
                                thoroughly and the plan to design the app accordingly is made. Major tasks like:</p>
                            <ul class="pl-15">
                                <li>Analyzing and understanding the target audience’s demands from the app is done.</li>
                                <li>The noteworthy features that competitors’ apps have is noted and if possible those
                                    features and useful additional features are incorporated into the app.</li>
                                <li>All the features and functionalities that the app will have are decided.</li>
                                <li>The coding technology or the SDK platform used to design the app is decided.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>Apps can be classified into two types namely native apps and hybrid apps. Since there
                                are only two major mobile OS platforms in the world namely iOS and Android, native
                                apps belong to these two mobile OS platforms.</p>
                            Native android apps are either coded in Kotlin or Java. Native iOS apps are coded in the
                            Swift
                            programming language which was recently developed by Apple in 2014.</p>

                            <p>There are three major SDKs used to develop hybrid apps i.e., apps that can run on
                                Android and iOS with minimal alterations to their source code. They are Flutter,
                                Xamarin, and React Native.</p>
                            <p>The Flutter SDK uses the Dart coding technology to design cross-platform apps.
                                Xamarin uses the C#.net programming language to design hybrid apps and the React
                                Native SDK uses HTML 5 and Javascript coding technologies to design hybrid apps.</p>

                            <h3 id="2">Designing A Wireframe For The App</h3>
                            <p>A wireframe is a low-fidelity outlay of the app. It gives a fair idea of what the app
                                is going to look like, what will be the options present on the app, how will the
                                information be displayed on the app, etcetera. After frequent consultations with the
                                client, the wireframe of the app is refined until the ultimate high-fidelity variant
                                of it is produced.</p>
                            <p>Based on this high-fidelity wireframe of the app, the roadmap for the app’s
                                development is built. The roadmap for the app development dictates the order of the
                                construction of app features and filling of information on the app.</p>
                            <p>One must analyze the concerned app store/s and ensure that the name decided for the
                                app isn’t already in use lest it’ll become a copyright issue.</p>


                            <h3 id="3">Designing The UI/UX Of The App</h3>
                            <p>The appeal of an app’s UI/UX will have an impact on user engagement and retention.
                                Therefore, the UI/UX of an app has to be sophisticated yet easy to navigate.</p>
                            <p>Workflow diagrams help app developers analyze and correct if necessary all the possible
                                scenarios when users interact with the app. This is done to provide app users a seamless
                                and smooth experience when interacting with the app.</p>

                            <h3 id="4">Coding The App</h3>
                            <p>The coding of the app has to be done in accordance with the high-fidelity wireframe of
                                the app developed earlier in the app design process. Every required feature and
                                functionality of the app has to be tested thoroughly once developed to maintain the
                                functional integrity of the app. Only the most suitable coding technology has to be
                                employed to code the app to produce the best and the most appropriate app.</p>
                            <p>Coding the app mainly involves three main phases. They are: designing the UI/UX of the
                                app, designing an API for the app to enable communication between the server and the
                                app, and coding the backend functionalities of the app to enable flawless interaction
                                between users and the app</p>

                            <h3 id="5">Testing The App</h3>
                            <p>The app once designed should be tested in all the important parameters. The app’s UI/UX
                                should be tested to see if it is appealing and gives a great user interaction
                                experience.</p>
                            <p>All the required functionalities of the app should be tested thoroughly to safeguard the
                                functional integrity of the app. The app should function swiftly, seamlessly, and
                                securely to give an enjoyable user experience. If the app is a hybrid app, then it
                                should function swiftly and seamlessly in both the Android and iOS mobile OS platforms.
                            </p>
                            <p>The more thoroughly the app is tested, the more its functional integrity will be
                                maintained, the more content your client will feel, and the more downloads, ratings, and
                                positive reviews the app will get.</p>

                            <h3 id="6">Deployment And Support</h3>

                            <p>While deploying the app on the appropriate app store, developers should ensure the
                                following things:</p>

                            <li>The app should have a catchy name that is unique.</li>
                            <li>The app should have a concise yet compelling description to heighten app downloads.</li>
                            <li>The app should have an attractive and unique logo to create a strong identity for the
                                brand (your client company).</li>
                            <li>Eye-catching screenshots from various use cases should be uploaded to convince customers
                                to download the app.</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>Once the app is appropriately deployed on the suitable app store or both the app stores
                                (Play Store and The App Store) in case of hybrid apps, appropriate ASO (App Store
                                Optimization) techniques need to be applied on the app to make it rank on app store
                                searches.</p>
                            <p>Even high quality Social Media Marketing (SMM) techniques and practices can be applied to
                                make the app popular among the business’s target audience and to enhance app downloads.
                            </p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the app has to be maintained (checking for runtime bugs and
                                correcting them) and updated (if required) to maintain the user experience (UX) of the
                                app and the user base of the client company.</p>
                            <p>The mobile app development process cost is not a fixed entity but a variable one. It
                                depends on a multitude of factors like the number and complexity of the desired
                                features, the experience and expertise of the app development team, the nationality of
                                the app developers, and the coding technology and SDK used.</p>
                            <p>Generally speaking, developing an on-demand delivery app can cost anywhere between USD
                                6,000 to USD 40,000/-.</p>
                            <h2>What is the growth of app development in India?</h2>
                            <p>App Revenue Growth in India. From the above graph, we find that app revenue in India grew
