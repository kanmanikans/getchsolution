                            <p>Cost To Develop Restaurant App is the buzzword these days. People of all ages and
                                professions use various types of mobile apps for various purposes. This is because
                                modern day mobile apps are very sophisticated, versatile, fast, and secure. Mobile apps
                                also have a large user base, owing to their popularity with people, which many
                                businesses find convenient.</p>

                            <p>It is the same scenario with the restaurant industry. Many restaurants already have a
                                dedicated mobile app for themselves or are trying to build one in order to leverage the
                                manifold benefits that restaurant food ordering apps have to offer.</p>

                            <p>We shall have a detailed study of the benefits of restaurant food ordering apps for
                                restaurant business owners in the coming section.</p>


                            <h2 id="1">The Innumerable And Invaluable Benefits Of Restaurant Food Ordering Apps</h2>

                            <p>restaurant food ordering apps offer innumerable and invaluable benefits to restaurant
                                business owners. They help improve the restaurant business in all aspects. Here’s how.
                            </p>


                            <h3>Reaching A Wider Target Audience</h3>

                            <p>Due to the reach and the clout of the internet and social media platforms and due to the
                                precise and feature-rich digital ad campaign manager tools available these days,
                                promoting your restaurant food ordering apps on various social media platforms and
                                groups has become child’s play.</p>

                            <p>You can effectively reach and influence a wider range of your target audience. Your
                                restaurant’s app can be promoted on relevant social media platforms and groups free of
                                charge or you can run targeted paid ad campaigns on relevant social media platforms and
                                groups.</p>

                            <p>Even these targeted paid ad campaigns are far more cost-effective to run than traditional
                                forms of advertising like newspaper ads, radio ads, billboard ads, etcetera and give far
                                higher ROIs.</p>


                            <h3>Flawless Execution Of Customers’ Orders</h3>

                            <p>Until about a decade back, takeaways used to be ordered by customers via landline phones.
                                Hence, there was always the chance that any restaurant’s customer care executives could
                                misunderstand their respective customers owing to their vague accents and deliver some
                                inappropriate (unordered) food items thus incorrectly executing their respective
                                customers’ orders.</p>

                            <p>The problem of incorrect execution of customers’ orders is eliminated if customers use
                                their desired restaurant’s food ordering app to order food from the restaurant. The
                                order details in the restaurant’s food ordering app will be in the form of simple
                                English and numbers which are very hard to misunderstand. Hence, near flawless execution
                                of customers’ orders is certain.</p>

                            <p>cost to develop restaurant app also employ an impeccable and efficient Order Management
                                System (OMS) which aids in seamless and swift execution of customers’ orders. The OMS
                                streamlines restaurants’ business processes, minimizes delays and errors, and makes the
                                process of food delivery, efficient and dependable. Modern day OMSs reduce operational
                                costs and give restaurants high ROIs in the long run.</p>


                            <h3>Granular Control Of Business Operations</h3>

                            <p>The admin app variant of restaurant food ordering apps are feature-rich and
                                sophisticated. They have versatile and elaborate features that give restaurant business
                                owners granular control over their business operations.</p>

                            <p>Using the features of the admin app, restaurant business owners can issue orders to and
                                coordinate with all their staff in any department like delivery executives, branch
                                managers, chefs, logistics partners, and maybe even farm owners to ensure the smooth
                                execution of business tasks and to maintain the inventory levels in all the restaurant
                                branches so that the restaurant’s customers can always order what they want via the
                                restaurant’s food ordering app.</p>

                            <p>The admin app variant will also have <a
                                    href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/blog/features-of-food-delivery-app/">robust
                                    features</a> that enable restaurant business owners to impeccably handle all their
                                business’s monetary transactions. They can pay their staff’s salaries and incentives and
                                supervise the payments received from their customers.</p>

                            <p>They can also introduce new, attractive offers and loyalty programs or make informed
                                changes to existing offers and loyalty programs to attract new customers and retain
                                existing ones. The admin app will have in-built and automated business analytical tools
                                that will provide valuable and actionable business insights to restaurant business
                                owners so that they can make informed business decisions.</p>

                            <p>All the above-mentioned business tasks can be done by just clicking a few buttons on the
                                admin app. Isn’t that convenient? Hence, we can safely conclude that restaurant food
                                delivery apps have made handling business operations a breeze for restaurant business
                                owners.</p>


                            <h3>Scaling Up The Business Is Easy And Cost-Effective</h3>

                            <p>Every restaurant is limited in its seating capacity and its ability to serve customers at
                                any given point in time. If a restaurant business were to build new branches and hire
                                additional staff to meet its increasing order flow then it would cost the restaurant
                                quite a lot of money and the restaurant would get a marginally positive ROI at best.</p>

                            <p>On the other hand, if it had developed its own food ordering app then it would be able to
                                easily meet its rising business volume and serve a lot more customers at any given point
                                in time.</p>

                            <p>Since the restaurant’s customers are ordering food from their homes via the restaurant’s
                                food ordering app, the seating/serving capacity limitations of the restaurant do not
                                come into play and the restaurant can scale up its business with ease and with minimal
                                additional infrastructure and staffing costs.</p>

                            <p>Last but not least, restaurants also need not worry about the visibility of their
                                restaurant business on third party food aggregator apps if they have their own app for
                                food delivery. Restaurants can save a lot on paying commissions on their profits earned
                                to third party food delivery firms if they have their own app for food ordering.</p>

                            <p>Thus, the benefits of food ordering apps for restaurant businesses are innumerable and
                                invaluable. Hence, they should undertake serious efforts to develop a top-notch food
                                delivery app for themselves. It’s the only way to grow their businesses easily and
                                cost-effectively and be ahead of their competitors.</p>

                            <p>If you want a&nbsp;<a

                                aspects, then come straight to us and we’ll make it happen. Our app development services

                            <h2 id="2">Is The Cost To Create A Restaurant App Influenced By Any Factors?</h2>

                            <p>Certainly! There is no fixed cost to create a restaurant app. It’s determined by quite a
                                few factors which are listed below.</p>

                            <h3>Number And Complexity Of The Desired App Features</h3>

                            <p>Obviously, the more the number of app features you want, the more development time it’s
                                going to take and the more it’ll cost you. If you want advanced and complex features to
                                be installed in your restaurant food delivery app, then too it’s going to cost you more
                                as developing complicated and elaborate app features requires a great deal of technical
                                expertise and app development time.</p>

                            <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>

                            <p>A simple restaurant food ordering app interface will only cost you an average of around
                                USD 4,000 to design whereas a swanky and feature-rich UI that is versatile yet simple to
                                use will cost you between USD 15,000 to USD 20,000 to design. Advanced yet simple to use
                                UIs have a higher user engagement rate when compared to simple UIs.</p>

                            <h3>The Nationality And Experience Of App Developers</h3>

                            <p>Experienced app developers will obviously charge you more for their app development
                                services as they have more proven technical experience and expertise whereas freshers in
                                the app development domain will be a lot less expensive to hire as they’ll be facing
                                high competition, yearning to get good app development projects, and have to prove
                                themselves first before they increase their hourly rates.</p>

                            <p>App developers from different regions of the world also charge variedly for their app
                                development services.</p>

                            <p>App developers from developed nations like the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, etcetera
                                charge more for their app development services when compared to app developers from
                                developing nations like India, China, Malaysia, etcetera.</p>

                            <p>This could be due to stiffer competition in developing countries for high-paying,
                                white-collar jobs like mobile app development. The table below shows the average per
                                hour rates of mobile app developers in various nations.</p>

                            <p><u><i>The US:</i></u>&nbsp;Mobile app developers from the US are the costliest to hire.
                                Their average hourly charge ranges between USD 50 to USD 250. This could be due to the
                                sparse competition in the US in the mobile app development domain and also due to the
                                high technical expertise of mobile app developers there.</p>

                            <p><u><i>Europe:</i></u>&nbsp;European app developers may be costly or cheap to hire. Their
                                hourly app development charge varies widely between USD 30 to USD 150.</p>

                            <p>You may hire a cost-effective European app developer depending on your budget and app
                                functionality requirements but kindly ensure that you get value for your money and not a
                                poorly designed app that will bodge the public image and reputation of your restaurant
                                business.</p>

                            <p><u><i>Australia:</i></u>&nbsp;App developers from Australia are somewhat expensive to
                                hire. They charge anywhere from USD 80 to USD 120 per hour for their app development
                                services.</p>

                            <p><u><i>India:</i></u>&nbsp;Indian app developers are the most sought-after by firms around
                                the world. This is because they are skilled yet cost-effective to hire. Indian app
                                developers charge only between USD 10 to USD 80 per hour for their app development
                                services. This could be due to the exceptionally high competition in India to secure
                                high paying, white collar jobs like mobile app development.</p>


                            <h3>The App Development Platform Used</h3>

                            <p>Different app development platforms and coding languages are used to develop native or
                                cross-platform apps for Android or iOS. The “Kotlin” programming language is used to
                                develop native Android apps. The “Swift” programming language is used to develop native
                                iOS apps.</p>

                            <p>Certain app development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter are used to
                                develop cross-platform apps. The employ different app coding technologies like
                                Javascript, C#.net, and Dart respectively to design cross-platform apps.</p>

                            <p>The different coding technologies differ in their capabilities (the functionality of the
                                respective features) and complexity. Hence, app developers using different app
                                development platforms and coding technologies charge varied hourly rates for their app
                                development services.</p>


                            <h3>After Release Services</h3>

                            <p>If you want your app development agency to optimize your restaurant food delivery app to
                                rank on various app stores (Play Store and The App Store) after its release into the
                                market, then obviously they will charge extra for the service.</p>

                            <p>If you want to employ Social Media Marketing (SMM) techniques as well to promote your app
                                on appropriate social media platforms and groups then too, it’s going to cost you more.
                                In short, availing additional services after the completion of app development will
                                always bring you additional costs that you’ll have to be ready to bear.</p>

                            <p>If you’re looking for additional services after the completion of restaurant food
                                ordering app development like App Store Optimization (ASO), Social Media Marketing
                                (SMM), etc., you can always discuss your plans with us. We will provide you the
                                best-in-class services at very reasonable prices.</p>

                            <p>Generally speaking, the cost of restaurant apps varies between USD 6,500 to USD 40,000
                                depending on the app features, UI, and additional services you require post the release
                                of the app.</p>
