                            </h2>

                            <p>A cloud kitchen is also known as a “ghost kitchen” or a “virtual kitchen”. It is a
                                commercial kitchen space that can be used to cook and deliver food to customers or it
                                can be rented by restaurants to fulfill their daily orders as they are cheaper than
                                buying complete restaurant spaces (dining area + kitchen + cleaning area). Cloud
                                kitchens do not have any seating areas for customers. They are only meant to cook and

                                capital to found a complete restaurant. Cloud kitchens cost much less to setup and run
                                as business owners need not pay any property tax. Cloud kitchens can be run with the
                                minimal amount of kitchen staff unlike restaurant kitchens. This drastically reduces
                                expenditure in the form of staff salaries and incentives. They are also far easier to
                                maintain than restaurant kitchens owing to their significantly smaller size.
                            </p>

                            <p>Ever since the advent of the pandemic in 2019, far fewer people are going in person to
                                dine at restaurants. Most people now prefer ordering takeaways. Hence, setting up cloud
                                kitchens is a far safer and stable option for entrepreneurs willing to tap into the
                                enormous earning potential of the food industry.

                            </p>

                            <p>Setting up cloud kitchens will enable their businesses to perform well even when new
                                “waves” of the pandemic strike and during normal times. Cloud kitchens are better
                                equipped to handle large fluctuations in demand as their running cost overhead is far
                                lesser than restaurants.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Cloud Kitchen Business Models
                            </h2>
                            <p>Though the concept of cloud kitchens is new (started around 2010 in New York first), the
                                cloud kitchen business has grown and evolved exponentially since its inception. As of
                                today, there are seven types of cloud kitchen business models, which we’ll have a look
                                at in the following section.

                            </p>

                            <h3 id="1">Independent Cloud Kitchen Model
                            </h3>
                            <p>Here, the business owner who had founded the cloud kitchen accepts orders from food
                                aggregator apps and sometimes even restaurants. His business will be listed on various
                                food aggregator apps in exchange for giving the agreed upon commissions on his profits.
                                Independent cloud kitchens were the first type of cloud kitchen businesses to be
                                founded. Independent cloud kitchens rank among the busiest commercial kitchens these
                                days.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="2">Brand Owned Cloud Kitchen
                            </h3>

                            <p>Here, the business owner owns and runs the cloud kitchen under his brand (single). He
                                will usually have his own app for food delivery but his brand will also be listed on
                                various food aggregator apps. Examples of brand owned cloud kitchens include Faasos,
                                Fresh Menu, etcetera.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="3">Multibrand Cloud Kitchens
                            </h3>

                            <p>This is quite a rare and complex cloud kitchen model. Here, a few restaurants in a small
                                locality co-own and co-run the cloud kitchen. This will reduce the operational costs for
                                the restaurants and create a win-win situation for all the restaurants who co-run the
                                cloud kitchen.
                            </p>

                            <p>Generally small restaurant owners do not have the investment capital or revenue to scale
                                up their kitchen size and cater to more of their customers’ orders. Buying large scale
                                and hi-tech commercial kitchen equipments is also not possible for them.
                            </p>

                            <p>However, if a few small restaurant business owners come together and invest a small
                                portion of their profits into setting up a hi-tech multibrand cloud kitchen, they can
                                tend to more of their customers’ orders and prepare more exotic dishes for their
                                customers.
                            </p>

                            <p>The facilities and equipments inside a multibrand cloud kitchen are shared between the
                                chefs and other staff of the restaurant brands who co-own and co-run the multibrand
                                cloud kitchen.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="4">Middle Ground Cloud Kitchen Model
                            </h3>
                            <p>Here, the cloud kitchen business simply prepares its customers’ orders and keeps them at
                                its dedicated pickup section. The food packages are labeled appropriately so that it
                                becomes easy for the respective customers to pick them up.
                            </p>

                            <p>Yes, you read it right; “pick them up”. Middle ground cloud kitchen brands do not deliver
                                their customers’ orders to them. They require customers to come and pick them up at
                                their physical outlets. This model of cloud kitchen business is very rare and none of
                                the popular brands of cloud kitchens employ this business model.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="5">Hub And Spoke Cloud Kitchen Model
                            </h3>

                            <p>Here a central cloud kitchen (a large one) has branch cloud kitchens (much smaller ones)
                                at neighboring localities. The central cloud kitchen handles some of the orders from all
                                of its branch cloud kitchens. It also supplies all of its branch cloud kitchens with raw
                                food items from time to time to maintain their inventory levels at optimum levels. This
                                model of cloud kitchen business is again quite rare.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="6">Outsourced Cloud Kitchen Model
                            </h3>

                            <p>Here, the cloud kitchen brand outsources its customers’ orders to another cloud kitchen
                                business. After receiving the cooked food, the company’s staff heat the food if
                                required, decorate it with appropriate herbs, nuts, fruits (like pomegranate), etcetera,
                                and package the food nicely before delivering it to their customers.
                            </p>

                            <p>In other words, the outsourcing cloud kitchen brand simply “polishes” the received food
                                (cooked food) and delivers it to its customers. This model of cloud kitchen business
                                requires the minimal amount of investment and incurs minimal running costs but is rare.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="7">Aggregator Cloud Kitchen Model
                            </h3>

                            <p>Just like co-working office spaces, aggregator cloud kitchens are co-working kitchen
                                spaces. Here, there is one very large commercial kitchen (usually occupying a couple of
                                floors in a commercial building) and in that large commercial kitchen, many food
                                delivery brands cook their customers’ orders. All the brands working inside the
                                aggregator cloud kitchen pay a fixed amount as rent to the kitchen complex owner.
                            </p>

                            <p>Having known about the advantages that cloud kitchens offer over traditional brick and
                                mortar restaurants, you might be thinking of starting your own cloud kitchen business
                                but you might also want to know about the cloud kitchen development cost. If so, kindly

                            <h3 id="8">An Efficient POS System
                            </h3>

                            <p>POS stands for Point Of Sale as far as cloud kitchens are concerned. Your cloud kitchen
                                should have an efficient system in place to automatically enter the order details
                                received from your customers, food aggregator apps, and possible even restaurants.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="9">Smart Inventory Management
                            </h3>

                            <p>It is advisable to have smart systems in your cloud kitchen that can automatically track
                                your inventory levels and give you notifications when the inventory levels of certain
                                food items become low. Maintaining optimum inventory levels of all the food items in
                                your cloud kitchen is necessary to maintain smooth business operations.

                            </h3>
                            <p>It is advisable to install and configure security surveillance cameras in your cloud
                                kitchen to detect and correct any shady activities or “accidental ingredients adding”
                                that might occur. After all, security is a fundamental requirement for any business.

                            <p>A Kitchen Display System (KDS) is basically a large tv/computer monitor, connected to a
                                computer that provides real time order information and status updates. It is required to
                                correctly and smoothly execute your customers’ orders.

                            <p>In case any hassles arise while delivering your customers’ orders, you should have a set
                                of telephones in your cloud kitchen so that your customer care executives or order
                                managers can talk to the concerned delivery boys and resolve their commutation issues.
                                Having this system in place will enable you to preserve the operational integrity of
                                your business and maintain your customer satisfaction and retention levels.

                                execution, you must have an appropriate CRM system (live chat system that also gives all
                                the details of your customers) in place to address those issues effectively.
                            </p>
