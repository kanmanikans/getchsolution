                            <p>The internet and mobile apps have become very popular among organizations and people
                                these days. This is because mobile apps are fast and convenient to use. They also
                                satisfy various needs that people and businesses have everyday. As of today, in the
                                mobile OS market, there are two major players or service providers. One is the
                                Google-owned Android mobile OS. The other one is the Apple-owned iOS. Together, these
                                mobile OSs have about 99% of the mobile OS market share. In the mobile OS market, as of
                                now, Android has 71.43% market share and iOS has 27.85% market share. The remaining
                                meager market share is controlled by Samsung and Fuchsia. So, clearly, developing an
                                Android app would help any business attract a lion’s share of mobile app users. Are
                                there any other benefits to developing an Android app? Kindly read on to find out.

                            <p>In this phase of the Android app development, you plan and build a roadmap for the
                                development of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of your Android app. Once your roadmap
                                has been finalized, you start building a wireframe for your android app’s MVP. The
                                wireframe will usually undergo many revisions before it’s finalized.

                            </p>
                            <p>The wireframe will give you a fair idea of how your Android app will look and function.
                                Your Android app must have an advanced, attractive, and engaging UI to maximize user
                                engagement and retention. Your Android app must make its usage, a seamless and
                                effortless experience for your target audience.

                            </h3>
                            <p>The programming language used to code your Android app depends a lot on what kind of app
                                you require. The programming languages Java or Kotlin are used to design native Andoid
                                apps. Mobile app development platforms like React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin and their
                                respective coding technologies like Javascript, Dart, and C# are used to design
                                cross-platform apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>Coding an Android app involves designing its front-end UI (User Interface) and back-end
                                server coding. These functionalities are coded by seperate front-end and back-end teams.
                                The UI shows the layout of the app and is used to interact with the user and the
                                back-end code enables the functionalities of each of the features displayed in the app’s
                                UI.

                            <p>The source code of your app has to be compliant with its finalized wireframe, concise,
                                seamless, and efficient. You must employ the best coding technologies and
                                internationally accepted app design practices to design highly appealing and efficient
                                Android apps.

                            <p>Your Android app has to be thoroughly tested on all parameters and use case scenarios to
                                ensure its flawless functioning. Even its UI has to be tested to see if it’s appealing.
                                The more thoroughly your Android app is tested, the lesser the chances of it failing
                                under certain use case scenarios or not meeting certain performance parameters.

                            <p>Android apps are far more cost-effective to develop, deploy, maintain, and upgrade than
                                iOS apps. Android app developers are also available worldwide in large numbers when
                                compared to native iOS app developers. Hence, organizations of all sizes mostly prefer
                                to develop native Android apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>Since Android apps and smartphones have a very large user base worldwide, they usually
                                give app developers and firms very high ROIs. Android apps are also far easier to
                                maintain and upgrade than iOS apps. Hence, even post deployment, Android apps save money
                                for organizations.
