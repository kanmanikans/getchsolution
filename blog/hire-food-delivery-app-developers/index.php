                            <p>By the end of 2020, the industry’s size swelled to USD 4.35 billion. The present
                                valuation of the food delivery industry in India is USD 13 billion and by the end of
                                2025, the size of the food delivery industry in India is expected to reach USD 21.41
                                billion.</p>

                            <p>Clearly, the growth of the food delivery industry in India has been exponential. This is
                                primarily because FDIs have been pouring into this industry since 2017 and because the
                                number of internet and mobile app users in India has been increasing exponentially since
                                2014.</p>

                            <p>Currently, the online food ordering business is very lucrative and profitable in India.

                            <p>Unfortunately, there is no concrete answer to this question. Whom you Choose Food
                                Delivery App Developers development project depends on a multitude of factors including
                                your app requirements and budget. We shall have a detailed study of the pros and cons of
                                each approach in the coming section.</p>

                            <h3>Freelancer</h3>
                            <p>Freelancers who are well versed with the required app development programming language/s
                                can be chosen for your food delivery app development project. It is always better to
                                check the freelancers’ resumes and hire someone with proven experience in the app
                                development domain. While freelancers in India are cost-effective to hire and can
                                develop a food delivery app for you, there are quite a few cons to hiring them like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You cannot enter into contracts with them and secure their commitment to the Choose
                                    Food Delivery App Developers project.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>They cannot provide maintenance or <a
                                        href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/digital-marketing/mobile-app-marketing-company/">social
                                        media promotion</a> for your food delivery app once the project is complete.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Freelancers might also be working for other clients. So, their attention and
                                    commitment to your project might be divided, which may lead to poor results or not
                                    all of your project requirements being fulfilled.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Since your hired freelancer will do all the aspects of your app development project,
                                    it will certainly take a longer time for him or her to deliver the final app after
                                    testing it when compared to the time taken by app development agencies for the same
                                    project. So, you really have to follow up with your freelancer to ensure that your
                                    food delivery app development project is completed within the given deadline.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Freelance app developers are not bound by the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) act
                                    of the Indian government. Hence, they may leak your food delivery app layout and
                                    fictionality ideas to their other clients or your competitors.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>You have to ensure that your hired freelancer speaks the same language that you’re
                                    comfortable with (it could be English or any other Indian regional language).
                                    Otherwise, coordination during the course of project execution will become a
                                    problem.</li>
                                <br>
                                <p>Generally, startups in the food industry that have a budget of less than USD 10,000
                                    for their food delivery app development project will opt for hiring freelancers.</p>

                                    freelance food delivery app developers. This is because you can enter into contracts
                                    with app development firms to ensure that you receive your project’s deliverables on
                                    time. You can even sue the app development firm if your food delivery app
                                    development project has been executed incorrectly or is delayed beyond acceptable
                                    limits.</p>

                                    high quality food delivery app from them.</p>

                                <li>They will cost you more than hiring freelancers for your food delivery app
                                    development project as they need to pay their staff’s salaries and also cover
                                    miscellaneous operational expenses like office rent, electricity bill, etcetera.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>You need to ensure that their office hours coincides with your available time to

                                    and that there is a lot of money to be made in this industry, you will most probably
                                    be thinking of developing a high-end food delivery app for your food preparation

                                <p>Here’s the problem. Only if you consult with a genuine app development firm, your
                                    delivery clone app developers will be of good quality and will give you a high ROI.
                                    On the
                                    contrary, if you approach shady and hollow mobile app development agencies, you will
                                    not get the desired features in your food delivery app and it might not give you a
                                    positive ROI.</p>

                                <p>So, how do you filter bonafide app development agencies from shady and hollow ones?
                                    We’ll have a detailed study of that in the following section.</p>


                                <h3>Check The Agency’s App Development Portfolio</h3>
                                <p>Any genuine app development organization will have a well-organized official website.
                                    In that website, the app development firm’s app development portfolios will be
                                    listed. Go through them and see if they sound honest and believable. If they do,
                                    then go ahead with consulting with the company.</p>

                                <p>An app development portfolio is nothing but the list of successfully completed app
                                    development projects by the app development agency.</p>


                                <h3>See The Company’s Ex-Clients’ Reviews</h3>
                                <p>This is a strong indicator of whether the app development firm is veritable or not.
                                    Numerous positive client reviews on the app development company’s official website
                                    signify that the app development agency is an authentic one.</p>

                                <p>More than three poor reviews indicate that the app development firm is not a genuine
                                    one and cannot execute your app development project satisfactorily. You should look
                                    for other app development agencies in that case.</p>


                                <h3>See If They Employ Recommended App Development Practices</h3>
                                <p>A company’s app development practices describe how the company will go about
                                    developing your on-demand food delivery app. Your client company’s app development
                                    practices have to be internationally recognized and recommended.</p>

                                <p>The company should not employ any illegal or sketchy methods to quickly complete your
                                    app development project. They should be open about their methods of working and keep
                                    you periodically updated regarding the project’s progress.</p>

                                <h3>Check If They Employ The Latest Coding Technologi</h3>
                                <p>Your app development agency should only employ the latest and most advanced coding
                                    technologies or platforms to develop your food delivery app. Only then your
                                    on-demand food delivery app will be feature-rich and will perform well.</p>

                                <p>Different coding technologies are used to develop apps for different mobile OS
                                    platforms. The coding language ‘Kotlin’ is used to develop high-performance native
                                    Android apps whereas the coding technology ‘Swift’ is used to develop
                                    high-performance native iOS apps.</p>

                                <p>Some mobile app development platforms like React Native, Xamarin, and Flutter can be
                                    used to develop cross-platform mobile apps (<a
                                        href="https://gtechwebsolutions.com/service/mobile-app-development/iphone-application/">apps
                                        that can run on iOS</a> as well as Android) but the performance of
                                    cross-platform mobile apps has been observed to be a shade lower than native apps.
                                </p>

                                <p>So, you must tell your food delivery app development agency to employ that app coding
                                    technology that most suits your project requirements and the region of the world you
                                    are going to deploy your app in.</p>

                                <p>iOS apps are the most popular in developed nations like the USA, Canada, Japan,
                                    etcetera. Android apps on the other hand are widely used in developing nations like
                                    India, China, Malaysia, etcetera.</p>


                                <h3>Check If They Have A Good Organizational Culture</h3>

                                <p>When considering How to Hire food app developers, it's essential to look for an app
                                    development organization with a positive work culture. Rather than imposing strict
                                    conditions on their employees, the organization should foster an environment that
                                    encourages creativity throughout the food delivery app development process. This
                                    approach is key to achieving the best results.</p>

                                <p>If your app development agency is too strict with its employees, if it extracts too
                                    much work from its employees and gives them too little payments, and if it does not
                                    allow any room for creativity in the food delivery app development process; chances
                                    are that that agency’s employees will become disgruntled and mess up your project.
                                </p>

                                <p>So, always choose a food delivery app development organization that’s liberal to the
                                    right extent and has conducive organizational culture to get the best results for
                                    your on-demand food delivery app development project.</p>


                                <h3>Get To Know The App Development Team</h3>
                                <p>While clients’ testimonials are a strong indicator of the authenticity of an app
                                    development firm, they are not decisive indicators. You can’t judge an app
                                    development organization to be good or bad based on their client reviews alone
                                    because sometimes clients can be paid ransoms to give good reviews.</p>

                                <p>Therefore, interacting with the app development team and their manager personally is
                                    the best way to get a fair idea of the authenticity, attitude, and commitment of an
                                    app development agency.</p>
