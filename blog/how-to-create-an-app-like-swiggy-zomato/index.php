                            <p>A food aggregator company’s Business Model Of Food Delivery App has two main types of
                                business partners namely restaurant partners and delivery partners. They coordinate with
                                each other under certain circumstances and ensure that the food delivery company’s
                                business operations run smoothly. Let’s now have a look in detail at their functioning.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Restaurant Partner Model</h3>
                            <p>Certain restaurants have partnered with food aggregator firms like Swiggy to heighten
                                their reach, business volume and profits. By encashing on food aggregator firms’ user
                                base and brand loyalty, partner restaurants can serve more customers without facing the
                                drawbacks of their limited seating capacity and popularity. If any restaurant is
                                offering any trendy or unique dishes, customers get to know about it via the food
                                aggregator app and order those dishes online. Thus the restaurant partner model benefits
                                both customers and partner restaurants.</p>

                            <h3>Delivery Partner Model</h3>
                            <p>Here, the food delivery company’s delivery executives deliver customers’ orders to them.
                                They earn a commission on every successful delivery. Delivery executives help food
                                aggregator companies make revenue by delivering their customers’ orders. Thereby
                                enabling the food aggregator companies to get commissions on the profits made by the
                                concerned restaurants. The delivery partner model also helps the company’s delivery
                                executives earn a commission on every successful delivery. Thus, it’s a win-win
                                situation for both parties. If you plan to <a
